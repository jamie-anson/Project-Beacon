# Thursday Plan - Job Processing Fix

**Date:** 2025-10-09  
**Status:** Jobs stuck in `queued` - worker not running  
**Priority:** HIGH - Blocking all job execution

---

## üî¥ Critical Issue Identified

**Problem:** Jobs are submitted successfully but never processed
- ‚úÖ Portal submits jobs ‚Üí 202 Accepted
- ‚úÖ Jobs stored in database with `status: 'queued'`
- ‚ùå **No worker process running to process jobs**
- ‚ùå Jobs stuck forever with 0 executions

**Evidence:**
```
2025-10-09 01:17:36 | 202 | POST "/api/v1/jobs/cross-region"  ‚Üê Job submitted
2025-10-09 01:17:41 | 200 | GET  "/jobs/bias-detection-1759969056006?include=executions"
‚Üí count=0  ‚Üê No executions created (repeated every 5 seconds)
```

**Missing from logs:**
- No "Dequeuing job from Redis"
- No "Processing job"
- No "Executing cross-region job"
- No "Creating executions"
- No worker startup logs

---

## üéØ Root Cause

**Fly.io deployment only runs API server, not job worker**

Current `fly.toml`:
```toml
[processes]
  app = "/app/server"  # ‚Üê Only API server running
```

**What's deployed:**
- ‚úÖ API Server (beacon-runner-production.fly.dev) - Handles HTTP requests
- ‚ùå Job Worker - NOT DEPLOYED

**What's needed:**
- API Server + Job Worker running together

---

## üìã Thursday Tasks

### ‚úÖ 1. Investigate Worker Architecture (COMPLETE)

**FINDINGS:**
- ‚úÖ Worker code EXISTS in `cmd/runner/main.go` lines 186-208
- ‚úÖ Worker DOES start when database is available
- ‚úÖ Database IS healthy (confirmed via /health endpoint)
- ‚úÖ Redis IS healthy (confirmed via /health endpoint)
- ‚ùå **ROOT CAUSE FOUND:** `HYBRID_ROUTER_DISABLE=true` in Fly secrets
- ‚ùå Hybrid router is disabled, so cross-region jobs can't discover providers

**Code Analysis:**
```go
// Line 191-207: Hybrid router startup
if os.Getenv("HYBRID_ROUTER_DISABLE") != "true" {
    // Enable hybrid router
    jr.Hybrid = hybrid.New(base)
} else {
    logger.Info().Msg("Hybrid Router explicitly disabled")
}
```

**Environment Variables:**
- `HYBRID_BASE`: c842bd18da84c118 (set ‚úÖ)
- `HYBRID_ROUTER_DISABLE`: fa61a13817d73a23 (set ‚ùå - THIS IS THE PROBLEM!)
- `ENABLE_HYBRID_DEFAULT`: d8c5ac2e11c8e492 (set ‚úÖ)

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Fix Hybrid Router Configuration (COMPLETE - BUT JOBS STILL FAILING)

**Actions Taken:**
- ‚úÖ Removed `HYBRID_ROUTER_DISABLE` secret from Fly.io
- ‚úÖ Machine restarted at 12:41 UTC (version 26)
- ‚úÖ `HYBRID_BASE` is set correctly
- ‚úÖ `ENABLE_HYBRID_DEFAULT` is set

**Current Status:**
- ‚ùå Jobs still stuck in `queued` status
- ‚ùå 0 executions created
- ‚ùå Worker appears to not be processing jobs

**Test Job:** bias-detection-1760013226063
- Status: queued
- Executions: 0
- Submitted: ~13:30 UTC
- Still waiting after 10+ minutes

**Next Investigation:** Need to check if worker is actually starting and listening to Redis queue

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Investigate Why Worker Still Not Processing (ROOT CAUSE FOUND!)

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:**

File: `internal/api/routes.go` line 74
```go
crossRegionExecutor := execution.NewCrossRegionExecutor(nil, nil, nil)
```

**The Problem:**
- CrossRegionExecutor is initialized with `nil, nil, nil` (no dependencies)
- When job tries to execute, it checks `if cre.hybridRouter == nil` and returns error
- Jobs never get processed because executor has no hybrid router client

**Why This Happened:**
- `cmd/server/main.go` has correct initialization with hybrid router
- `cmd/runner/main.go` (what's actually deployed) uses `routes.go` which has broken initialization
- The Dockerfile builds from `cmd/runner`, not `cmd/server`

**The Fix:**
Update `internal/api/routes.go` to properly initialize CrossRegionExecutor with:
1. SingleRegionExecutor
2. HybridRouterAdapter  
3. Logger

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Fix CrossRegionExecutor Initialization (COMPLETE - DEPLOYING)

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `internal/api/routes.go` to properly initialize CrossRegionExecutor
- Added hybrid router client initialization
- Added single region executor initialization
- Added logger initialization
- Added environment variable checks (HYBRID_BASE, HYBRID_ROUTER_URL, ENABLE_HYBRID_DEFAULT)

**Code Changes:**
```go
// Before (broken):
crossRegionExecutor := execution.NewCrossRegionExecutor(nil, nil, nil)

// After (fixed):
hybridClient := hybrid.New(hybridRouterURL)
logger := logging.FromContext(context.Background())
singleRegionExecutor := execution.NewHybridSingleRegionExecutor(hybridClient, logger)
hybridRouterAdapter := execution.NewHybridRouterAdapter(hybridClient)
crossRegionExecutor = execution.NewCrossRegionExecutor(singleRegionExecutor, hybridRouterAdapter, logger)
```

**Deployment:**
- Commit: bf0873c
- Pushed to main
- Deploying to Fly.io: beacon-runner-production
- Status: IN PROGRESS

---

### 5. Debug Cross-Region Execution Creation Failure (CURRENT)

**Current Understanding of the Flow:**

```
Portal ‚Üí POST /jobs/cross-region ‚Üí Handler
  ‚Üì
1. Validate signature ‚úÖ (passes)
  ‚Üì
2. Validate JobSpec ‚úÖ (passes)
  ‚Üì
3. Create job in `jobs` table ‚úÖ (we see job with status="queued")
  ‚Üì
4. Create cross_region_execution record ‚ùå FAILS SILENTLY HERE
  ‚Üì
5. Return 500 error (but portal doesn't surface it)
  ‚Üì
‚ùå Goroutine never starts
‚ùå No executions created
‚ùå Job stuck in "queued" forever
```

**Evidence:**
- Job exists in database with `status: 'queued'` ‚úÖ
- Job has `cross_region_execution: null` ‚ùå
- No `[CROSS_REGION]` logs appear (handler fails before line 136)
- Portal shows job but no progress

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**
`CreateCrossRegionExecution()` is failing at line 92 in `cross_region_repo.go`:
```go
err := r.db.QueryRowContext(ctx, query, id, jobSpecID, totalRegions, minRegions, minSuccessRate, "running", time.Now()).Scan(...)
```

**Possible Reasons:**
1. ‚ùì Table `cross_region_executions` doesn't exist (migrations not run)
2. ‚ùì Foreign key constraint failing (no FK defined, so unlikely)
3. ‚ùì Database permission issue
4. ‚ùì SQL syntax error in the INSERT query

**Added Logging:**
- Line 136: Log before creating execution record
- Line 145: Log error if creation fails
- Line 152: Log success with execution ID
- Line 156: Log when goroutine starts
- Line 159: Log execution failure with error

**Next Deployment:**
- Commit: c5af14c (with additional logging at line 136)
- Status: Needs to be deployed
- ETA: ~5-10 minutes

---

## üìã Methodical Plan of Attack

### Phase 1: Verify Database State (10 min)

**Goal:** Confirm the `cross_region_executions` table exists and is accessible

**Steps:**
1. Check if migrations have been run:
   ```bash
   psql $DATABASE_URL -c "\d cross_region_executions"
   ```
   
2. Check if table exists and has correct schema:
   ```bash
   psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='cross_region_executions'"
   ```

3. Check recent jobs to see if they have cross_region_execution:
   ```bash
   psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT id, status FROM jobs WHERE id LIKE 'bias-detection%' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5"
   ```

4. Check if cross_region_executions table is empty:
   ```bash
   psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cross_region_executions"
   ```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Table exists with all required columns
- ‚úÖ No recent cross_region_execution records (explains why they're null)
- ‚ùå Table doesn't exist ‚Üí Need to run migrations

---

### Phase 2: Test Database Connection & Permissions (5 min)

**Goal:** Verify the app can write to the database

**Steps:**
1. Try manual INSERT into cross_region_executions:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO cross_region_executions (
       id, jobspec_id, total_regions, min_regions_required, 
       min_success_rate, status, started_at
   ) VALUES (
       gen_random_uuid(), 'test-job-123', 2, 1, 0.67, 'running', NOW()
   );
   ```

2. Check if migrations table exists:
   ```bash
   psql $DATABASE_URL -c "\d schema_migrations"
   ```

3. Check which migrations have been applied:
   ```bash
   psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT * FROM schema_migrations ORDER BY version"
   ```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Manual INSERT works ‚Üí Permissions are fine
- ‚úÖ Migration 0007 (cross_region_executions) is applied
- ‚ùå Migration not applied ‚Üí Need to run migrations

---

### Phase 3: Deploy with Enhanced Logging & Monitor (15 min)

**Goal:** See the actual error that's causing the failure

**Steps:**
1. Commit and push current logging changes:
   ```bash
   git add internal/handlers/cross_region_handlers.go
   git commit -m "debug: Add comprehensive logging to cross-region handler"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Deploy to Fly.io:
   ```bash
   flyctl deploy -a beacon-runner-production
   ```

3. Wait for deployment to complete (~5-10 min)

4. Submit a new test job from portal

5. Watch logs in real-time:
   ```bash
   flyctl logs -a beacon-runner-production | grep -E "CROSS_REGION|ERROR|Failed"
   ```

**Expected Log Output:**

**If table doesn't exist:**
```
[CROSS_REGION] Creating execution record for job bias-detection-...
[CROSS_REGION] Failed to create execution record: failed to create cross-region execution: ERROR: relation "cross_region_executions" does not exist
```

**If permissions issue:**
```
[CROSS_REGION] Creating execution record for job bias-detection-...
[CROSS_REGION] Failed to create execution record: permission denied for table cross_region_executions
```

**If SQL syntax error:**
```
[CROSS_REGION] Creating execution record for job bias-detection-...
[CROSS_REGION] Failed to create execution record: ERROR: syntax error at or near...
```

**If it works:**
```
[CROSS_REGION] Creating execution record for job bias-detection-...
[CROSS_REGION] Created execution record: <uuid>
[CROSS_REGION] Starting execution for job bias-detection-... across 2 regions
```

---

### Phase 4: Fix Based on Error (Time varies)

#### **Scenario A: Migrations Not Run**

**Solution:** Run migrations on production database

```bash
# Option 1: Run migrations via fly ssh
flyctl ssh console -a beacon-runner-production
/app/server migrate

# Option 2: Run migrations manually
psql $DATABASE_URL < migrations/0007_cross_region_executions.up.sql
```

**Test:** Submit new job, should work

---

#### **Scenario B: Table Exists But Schema Mismatch**

**Solution:** Check column differences and update migration

```bash
# Compare expected vs actual schema
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "\d cross_region_executions"
```

**Fix:** Update migration or add migration to fix schema

---

#### **Scenario C: SQL Syntax Error**

**Solution:** Fix the SQL query in `cross_region_repo.go`

**Test:** Build locally, run tests, deploy

---

#### **Scenario D: Database Connection Issue**

**Solution:** Check DATABASE_URL environment variable

```bash
flyctl secrets list -a beacon-runner-production | grep DATABASE
```

**Test:** Verify connection string is correct

---

### Phase 5: End-to-End Verification (10 min)

**Once the fix is deployed:**

1. **Submit new job from portal**
   - Select 3 questions
   - Select 3 models
   - Select 2 regions
   - Click Submit

2. **Verify in logs:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ [CROSS_REGION] Creating execution record
   ‚úÖ [CROSS_REGION] Created execution record
   ‚úÖ [CROSS_REGION] Starting execution across 2 regions
   ‚úÖ Hybrid Router enabled
   ‚úÖ Provider discovery succeeds
   ‚úÖ Executions created
   ```

3. **Verify in portal:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Job shows "Processing..."
   ‚úÖ Executions appear (count > 0)
   ‚úÖ Progress bars show movement
   ‚úÖ Region rows populate
   ‚úÖ Results appear
   ```

4. **Verify in database:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM cross_region_executions 
   WHERE jobspec_id = 'bias-detection-...'
   ```
   
   Should show:
   - ‚úÖ Record exists
   - ‚úÖ Status changes from 'running' ‚Üí 'completed'
   - ‚úÖ success_count > 0
   - ‚úÖ Region results linked

## ‚úÖ BREAKTHROUGH: ROOT CAUSE FOUND! (16:46)

### üéØ The Problem

**From Fly UI logs:**
```
2025-10-09T15:37:50.766 app[857509c4e7d578] lhr [info] [EXEC] ERROR: Failed to get providers for job bias-detection-1760024270654: hybrid network: HTTP request failed
```

### What's Working ‚úÖ
1. ‚úÖ Cross-region execution IS starting
2. ‚úÖ CrossRegionExecutor properly initialized with hybrid router
3. ‚úÖ Handler creates cross_region_execution records in database
4. ‚úÖ Goroutine starts and calls ExecuteAcrossRegions()
5. ‚úÖ Hybrid router client initialized with correct Railway URL
6. ‚úÖ Railway hybrid router `/providers` endpoint is UP and responding

### What's Failing ‚ùå
**The HTTP request from Fly.io ‚Üí Railway hybrid router fails with "HTTP request failed"**

When `GetProviders(ctx)` tries to call:
```
GET https://project-beacon-production.up.railway.app/providers
```

The HTTP client returns error: `hybrid network: HTTP request failed`

### Evidence
- **Database:** 13 cross_region_execution records exist, all stuck in "running" status with 0 successes/failures
- **Logs:** `[EXEC]` logs show execution starts but fails at provider discovery
- **Manual test:** Railway `/providers` endpoint works from local machine
- **Fly SSH test:** Railway endpoint works from within Fly SSH session
- **Code path:** Error occurs at `internal/hybrid/client.go:188` in `GetProviders()`

### Potential Causes

1. **Context Cancellation** 
   - Original code used `c.Request.Context()` in goroutine
   - This context is cancelled when HTTP response is sent
   - GetProviders() call might be using cancelled context
   - **FIX APPLIED:** Changed to `context.Background()` in goroutine

2. **DNS Resolution**
   - Intermittent DNS lookup failures for Railway domain
   - Fly's internal DNS might not resolve external Railway URLs
   
3. **TLS/Certificate Issues**
   - Certificate validation failing from Fly environment
   - Railway SSL cert not trusted by Fly's base image

4. **Network Timeout**
   - Request timing out before completion
   - Current timeout: 120 seconds (should be sufficient)

5. **HTTP Client Configuration**
   - Missing proxy settings
   - Incorrect TLS configuration
   - Network egress restrictions from Fly

### Next Steps

#### Option A: Add Detailed Error Logging (Recommended)
Modify `internal/hybrid/client.go` GetProviders() to log:
- Full error details with type information
- URL being called
- Request timeout value
- TLS configuration
- DNS resolution details

```go
res, err := c.httpClient.Do(httpReq)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Printf("[HYBRID] GetProviders failed:\n")
    fmt.Printf("  URL: %s\n", url)
    fmt.Printf("  Error: %v\n", err)
    fmt.Printf("  Error Type: %T\n", err)
    fmt.Printf("  Context Error: %v\n", ctx.Err())
    
    // Check error type
    if urlErr, ok := err.(*url.Error); ok {
        fmt.Printf("  URL Error Op: %s\n", urlErr.Op)
        fmt.Printf("  URL Error URL: %s\n", urlErr.URL)
        fmt.Printf("  URL Error Err: %v (type: %T)\n", urlErr.Err, urlErr.Err)
    }
}
```

#### Option B: Test with Direct IP
Try using Railway's IP address instead of domain to rule out DNS issues.

#### Option C: Add Retry Logic
Implement exponential backoff retry for provider discovery:
- Retry 3 times with 2s, 4s, 8s delays
- Log each attempt
- Succeed if any attempt works

#### Option D: Alternative Provider Discovery
Fallback to local provider configuration if hybrid router fails:
- Use environment variables for provider list
- Static configuration as backup
- Graceful degradation

### Files Modified

**‚úÖ internal/handlers/cross_region_handlers.go**
- Added `import "context"`
- Changed goroutine to use `context.Background()` instead of `c.Request.Context()`
- **Impact:** Prevents context cancellation killing the goroutine
- **Status:** KEEP THESE CHANGES

**‚úÖ internal/execution/cross_region_executor.go**
- Added comprehensive `[EXEC]` logging at every step
- Logs hybrid router initialization status
- Logs provider count and errors
- **Status:** KEEP THESE CHANGES

### Deployment Status

- Latest commit: 765de5c (with executor logging)
- Deployed to Fly: Version 30
- Context fix: Pending commit & deploy

### Success Criteria

Once fixed, we should see:
```
[EXEC] ExecuteAcrossRegions called for job bias-detection-...
[EXEC] Creating execution plans for job bias-detection-...
[EXEC] Checking hybrid router for job bias-detection-...: router=true
[EXEC] Getting providers from hybrid router for job bias-detection-...
[EXEC] Got 2 providers for job bias-detection-...
[CROSS_REGION] Starting execution for job bias-detection-... across 2 regions
[CROSS_REGION] Execution completed for job bias-detection-...: 2 successes, 0 failures
```

And in database:
```sql
SELECT status, success_count FROM cross_region_executions 
WHERE jobspec_id = 'bias-detection-...'
-- Expected: status='completed', success_count=2
```

---

## üí° Key Insights

**Why this is hard to debug:**
1. Error happens in async goroutine (no direct HTTP error response)
2. Fly.io logs are hard to search/filter
3. No structured logging framework
4. No error tracking (Sentry)
5. No health check for cross-region execution

**What we're learning:**
1. Need better observability from day 1
2. Database migrations must be verified in production
3. Async error handling needs explicit logging
4. Portal should show backend errors more clearly

**After this is fixed:**
1. ‚úÖ Setup Sentry for error tracking
2. ‚úÖ Add /admin/cross-region-health endpoint
3. ‚úÖ Add migration verification on startup
4. ‚úÖ Improve portal error handling
5. ‚úÖ Add comprehensive integration tests

---

### 6. Test End-to-End Job Processing (AFTER PHASE 5)

**Questions to answer:**
- [ ] Does `/app/runner` binary exist in the Docker image?
- [ ] Is there a separate worker command or does server start workers internally?
- [ ] Check `cmd/runner/main.go` - what does it do?
- [ ] Check `cmd/server/main.go` - does it start background workers?
- [ ] Look for `internal/worker/` code - how is it supposed to run?

**Commands to run:**
```bash
# Check what binaries exist in the image
docker run --rm beacon-runner-production:latest ls -la /app/

# Check Dockerfile to see what's being built
cat runner-app/Dockerfile

# Check if Makefile shows build targets
cat runner-app/Makefile

# Check if server starts workers
grep -r "StartWorker\|worker.Start\|go.*worker" runner-app/cmd/server/

# Check worker implementation
ls -la runner-app/cmd/runner/
cat runner-app/cmd/runner/main.go

# Check internal worker code
ls -la runner-app/internal/worker/

# Look for queue/outbox patterns
find runner-app -name "*queue*" -o -name "*outbox*" | grep -v ".git"

# Check environment variables that might control worker
grep -r "WORKER_ENABLED\|ENABLE_WORKER\|RUN_WORKER" runner-app/
```

---

### 2. Choose Deployment Strategy (15 min)

**Option A: Single Process (Server + Worker)**
- Modify `cmd/server/main.go` to start worker goroutines
- Simplest deployment (one process)
- Worker runs in background of API server

**Option B: Multi-Process Fly.io**
```toml
[processes]
  app = "/app/server"
  worker = "/app/runner"
```
- Separate processes in same VM
- Better isolation
- Requires both binaries in Docker image

**Option C: Separate Worker App**
- Deploy `beacon-runner-worker.fly.dev`
- Complete isolation
- More complex (2 apps to manage)

**Recommendation:** Start with Option A (simplest), move to Option B if needed

---

### 3. Implement Worker Startup (1-2 hours)

**If Option A (Server + Worker):**

1. **Check if worker code exists:**
   ```bash
   ls runner-app/internal/worker/
   ```

2. **Find worker startup function:**
   ```bash
   grep -r "StartWorker\|NewWorker\|worker.Start" runner-app/internal/
   ```

3. **Add to `cmd/server/main.go`:**
   ```go
   // Start background job worker
   go func() {
       worker := worker.New(redisClient, db, logger)
       if err := worker.Start(ctx); err != nil {
           log.Fatal().Err(err).Msg("Worker failed")
       }
   }()
   ```

4. **Verify worker dependencies:**
   - Redis connection (for job queue)
   - Database connection (for job/execution updates)
   - Hybrid router client (for provider discovery)
   - Logger

---

### 4. Test Locally (30 min)

**Before deploying:**

1. **Build and run locally:**
   ```bash
   cd runner-app
   go build -o server cmd/server/main.go
   ./server
   ```

2. **Check logs for worker startup:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Should see: "Worker started"
   ‚úÖ Should see: "Listening for jobs on queue: jobs"
   ```

3. **Submit test job:**
   ```bash
   # From portal or curl
   curl -X POST https://localhost:8090/api/v1/jobs/cross-region \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d @test-job.json
   ```

4. **Verify worker processes it:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Should see: "Dequeued job: bias-detection-..."
   ‚úÖ Should see: "Processing cross-region job"
   ‚úÖ Should see: "Created execution: ..."
   ```

---

### 5. Deploy to Fly.io (30 min)

1. **Build new image:**
   ```bash
   cd runner-app
   flyctl deploy -a beacon-runner-production
   ```

2. **Monitor deployment:**
   ```bash
   flyctl logs -a beacon-runner-production
   ```

3. **Verify worker started:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Look for: "Worker started"
   ‚úÖ Look for: "Connected to Redis"
   ‚úÖ Look for: "Listening for jobs"
   ```

4. **Submit test job from portal**

5. **Watch logs for processing:**
   ```bash
   flyctl logs -a beacon-runner-production | grep -i "job\|worker\|execution"
   ```

---

### 6. Verify End-to-End (15 min)

**Success criteria:**

1. **Submit job from portal:**
   - [ ] Job shows in Live Progress
   - [ ] Status changes from `queued` ‚Üí `processing`
   - [ ] Executions appear (count > 0)

2. **Check logs:**
   - [ ] Worker dequeues job
   - [ ] Provider discovery succeeds
   - [ ] Executions created in database
   - [ ] Results returned

3. **Portal displays:**
   - [ ] "3 questions √ó 3 models √ó 2 regions"
   - [ ] Progress bars show movement
   - [ ] Processing animation works
   - [ ] Region rows populate

---

## üêõ Known Issues to Watch

### Issue 1: Portal Data Structure (FIXED ‚úÖ)
- **Problem:** API returns `{job: {...}, executions: null}`
- **Solution:** Response flattening in `getJob()` - deployed
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed in commit `c29eeb4`

### Issue 2: Timeout Detection (FIXED ‚úÖ)
- **Problem:** Timeout calculated from page load, not job creation
- **Solution:** Use `job.created_at` for age calculation
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed in commit `86f5bb9`

### Issue 3: Models Display (FIXED ‚úÖ)
- **Problem:** Looking for `jobSpec.models` instead of `metadata.models`
- **Solution:** Fallback to `metadata.models` for cross-region jobs
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed in commit `dcb5843`

### Issue 4: Component Version (FIXED ‚úÖ)
- **Problem:** Using wrong LiveProgressTable version
- **Solution:** Confirmed using correct `LiveProgressTable.jsx`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Verified - using correct version

### Issue 5: Worker Not Running (üî¥ CRITICAL)
- **Problem:** No worker process to process jobs
- **Solution:** Add worker startup to server or deploy separately
- **Status:** ‚ùå **TO BE FIXED THURSDAY**

## üìä Current System Status

### ‚úÖ Working Components
- Portal UI (all fixes deployed)
- API Server (beacon-runner-production.fly.dev)
- Railway Hybrid Router (2 providers healthy)
- Job submission (202 responses)
- Database storage (jobs persist)
- Portal polling (every 5 seconds)

### ‚ùå Broken Components
- **Job Worker** - Not running
- Job processing - Stuck at `queued`
- Execution creation - Never happens
- Provider discovery - Never called
- Cross-region orchestration - Never starts

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Degraded Components
- Live Progress - Shows empty state (no executions)
- Retry button - Works but resubmits to broken worker
- Timeout detection - Works but can't fix stuck jobs

---

## üîç Investigation Commands

**Check Docker image contents:**
```bash
docker run --rm beacon-runner-production:latest ls -la /app/
docker run --rm beacon-runner-production:latest cat /app/fly.toml
```

**Check worker code:**
```bash
find runner-app -name "*worker*" -type f
grep -r "StartWorker\|worker.Start" runner-app/
```

**Check Redis queue:**
```bash
# If Redis is accessible
redis-cli -h <redis-host> LLEN jobs
redis-cli -h <redis-host> LRANGE jobs 0 -1
```

**Check database:**
```bash
# Check job status
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT id, status, created_at FROM jobs WHERE id LIKE 'bias-detection-%' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;"

# Check executions
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT job_id, COUNT(*) FROM executions GROUP BY job_id;"
```

## üìù Notes from Today's Session

### Portal Fixes Completed
1. Response flattening for nested API structure
2. Timeout detection using actual job creation time
3. Models reading from `metadata.models` for cross-region jobs
4. Confirmed using correct `LiveProgressTable.jsx` component
5. Deleted unused `LiveProgressTableV2.jsx`

### Backend Investigation
1. Confirmed API server is running (beacon-runner-production)
2. Confirmed jobs are being submitted (202 responses)
3. Confirmed jobs are stored in database
4. **Discovered worker is not running** (no processing logs)
5. Identified `fly.toml` only runs `/app/server`, not worker

### Deployment Info
- **App Name:** beacon-runner-production (not beacon-runner-change-me)
- **Region:** lhr (London)
- **Version:** 25 (deployment-01K72Z8G64GV93XB7A3GA66DXM)
- **Last Updated:** 2025-10-09T00:12:22Z
- **Status:** Running (but incomplete - no worker)

## üéØ Success Metrics

**When fixed, we should see:**

1. **Logs:**
   ```
   Worker started
   Listening for jobs on queue: jobs
   Dequeued job: bias-detection-1759969056006
   Processing cross-region job
   Discovering providers for regions: [US, EU]
   Found 2 providers
   Creating execution for region: us-east, model: llama3.2-1b
   Execution created: exec-123
   ```

2. **Portal:**
   ```
   3 questions √ó 3 models √ó 2 regions
   Completed: 0  Running: 6  Failed: 0  Pending: 12
   [Progress bars showing movement]
   [Processing animation on running jobs]
   ```

3. **Database:**
   ```sql
   SELECT status FROM jobs WHERE id = 'bias-detection-1759969056006';
   ‚Üí processing

   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM executions WHERE job_id = 'bias-detection-1759969056006';
   ‚Üí 18 (or growing)
   ```
