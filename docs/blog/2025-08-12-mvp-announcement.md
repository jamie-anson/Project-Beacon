We are launching the MVP benchmark "Who are you?" — a deterministic CPU-only test validating the end-to-end flow: JobSpec → Runner (Golem) → Receipt → IPFS → Transparency Log → Diff Engine → Attestation Report.

See:
- Schemas: [JobSpec](/docs/schemas/jobspec/), [Receipt](/docs/schemas/receipt/), [DifferenceReport](/docs/schemas/difference-report/), [AttestationReport](/docs/schemas/attestation-report/)
