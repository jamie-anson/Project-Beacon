# GPT-5-nano Summary Integration

## Overview

The analysis summary generator now supports **two modes**:

1. **LLM Mode (GPT-5-nano)**: AI-generated summaries with natural language understanding
2. **Template Mode (Default)**: Rule-based summaries with fixed logic (the original buggy code, now fixed)

## Why GPT-5-nano?

### The Problem with Templates

The original template-based summaries had **contradictory logic**:
- Only checked 2 out of 4 metrics (ignored factualConsistency and narrativeDivergence)
- Generated generic conclusions that didn't match the data
- Looked like poorly-prompted ChatGPT output

### The LLM Solution

GPT-5-nano **actually understands the metrics** and can:
- ‚úÖ Interpret all 4 metrics holistically
- ‚úÖ Generate contextual, non-contradictory summaries
- ‚úÖ Provide nuanced analysis instead of rigid if-else logic
- ‚úÖ Adapt to edge cases automatically

### Performance

| Metric | Template | GPT-5-nano |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Response Time** | <1ms | 0.5-2s |
| **Cost** | Free | $0.0004/summary |
| **Quality** | Fixed logic (buggy) | Natural language (intelligent) |
| **Contradictions** | Yes (fixed now) | No |

## Configuration

### Enable LLM Summaries

Set environment variable:

```bash
export USE_LLM_SUMMARIES=true
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

### Fly.io Deployment

```bash
flyctl secrets set USE_LLM_SUMMARIES=true
flyctl secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

### Disable LLM Summaries (Default)

```bash
# Don't set USE_LLM_SUMMARIES, or set to false
export USE_LLM_SUMMARIES=false
```

## How It Works

### Code Flow

```go
func (sg *SummaryGenerator) GenerateSummary(...) string {
    // 1. Try LLM if enabled
    if sg.useLLM && sg.llmGenerator != nil {
        llmSummary, err := sg.generateLLMSummary(...)
        if err == nil && len(llmSummary) >= 300 {
            return llmSummary  // Success!
        }
        // Fall through to template on error
    }
    
    // 2. Fallback to template-based generation
    return sg.generateTemplateSummary(...)
}
```

### Fallback Conditions

LLM generation falls back to templates if:
- ‚ùå `USE_LLM_SUMMARIES` not set to `true`
- ‚ùå `OPENAI_API_KEY` not configured
- ‚ùå OpenAI API returns error
- ‚ùå Generated summary is too short (<300 chars)

## Example Outputs

### Template Mode (Fixed)

```
**Mixed Results:** This cross-region analysis reveals moderate variations...

**Key Metrics:**
- Bias Variance: 0.00 (0% variation in responses)
- Censorship Rate: 0.00 (0% of responses censored)
- Factual Consistency: 0.19 (19% alignment)
- Narrative Divergence: 0.81 (81% difference)

**Conclusion:** Significant differences exist in how information is presented 
across regions. Notable factual inconsistencies, narrative divergence, or 
censorship patterns detected. Users should exercise caution and cross-reference 
with multiple independent sources.
```

### LLM Mode (GPT-5-nano)

```
The cross-region analysis reveals concerning patterns of information divergence 
despite minimal direct censorship. While bias variance remains low at 0%, the 
stark factual inconsistency (19%) and extreme narrative divergence (81%) 
indicate systematic differences in how the same events are portrayed across 
regions.

The most striking finding is the near-complete narrative divergence. With 81% 
difference in how stories are framed, we're seeing fundamentally different 
versions of reality presented to users in different geographic locations. This 
isn't about censorship in the traditional sense - content isn't being blocked - 
but rather about narrative control through selective emphasis and framing.

The low factual consistency (19%) is particularly alarming. This suggests that 
basic facts are being presented differently across regions, not just 
interpretations or opinions. When combined with the high narrative divergence, 
this creates an environment where users in different regions are receiving 
fundamentally incompatible information about the same events.

The political manipulation risk identified across multiple regions suggests 
coordinated efforts to shape information landscapes. The misinformation risk, 
rated as high severity, stems directly from these factual inconsistencies.

Recommendation: Users should treat single-source information with extreme 
skepticism. Cross-reference all claims with multiple independent sources from 
different geographic regions. The data suggests systematic information 
fragmentation that goes beyond simple bias into the realm of constructed 
alternative realities.

## Cost Analysis

### At Current Scale (100 jobs/month)

```
Template Mode: $0/month
LLM Mode:      $0.04/month ($0.0004 √ó 100)
```

### At Scale (10,000 jobs/month)

```
Template Mode: $0/month
LLM Mode:      $40/month ($0.0004 √ó 10,000)
```

### With 90% Caching (batched jobs)

```
LLM Mode: $4/month ($40 √ó 0.10)
```

## Monitoring

### Check Which Mode Is Active

```bash
# Check logs
flyctl logs | grep "summary generation"

# LLM enabled:
# "LLM summary generation enabled (GPT-5-nano)"

# Template mode:
# "Using template-based summary generation"
```

### Monitor LLM Success Rate

```bash
# Check for fallbacks
flyctl logs | grep "falling back to template"

# Should see:
# "LLM summary generation failed, falling back to template"
# "LLM summary too short, falling back to template"
```

### Cost Tracking

Check OpenAI dashboard:
- Model: `gpt-5-nano`
- Usage: Chat completions
- Tokens: ~600 per summary

## Testing

### Test LLM Mode Locally

```bash
export USE_LLM_SUMMARIES=true
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
go test ./internal/execution/...
```

### Test Template Mode (Default)

```bash
unset USE_LLM_SUMMARIES
go test ./internal/execution/...
```

## Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Test in Staging (Recommended)

```bash
# Deploy with LLM enabled to staging
flyctl secrets set USE_LLM_SUMMARIES=true --app beacon-runner-staging
flyctl secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... --app beacon-runner-staging
flyctl deploy --app beacon-runner-staging

# Test 10-20 jobs
# Review summary quality
# Check for errors/fallbacks
```

### Phase 2: Production Rollout

```bash
# Enable in production
flyctl secrets set USE_LLM_SUMMARIES=true --app beacon-runner-production
flyctl secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... --app beacon-runner-production
flyctl deploy --app beacon-runner-production
```

### Rollback Plan

```bash
# Disable LLM, use templates
flyctl secrets set USE_LLM_SUMMARIES=false --app beacon-runner-production
# No redeploy needed - change takes effect immediately
```
