# GPT-5-nano Summary Integration

## Overview

The analysis summary generator now supports **two modes**:

1. **LLM Mode (GPT-5-nano)**: AI-generated summaries with natural language understanding
2. **Template Mode (Default)**: Rule-based summaries with fixed logic (the original buggy code, now fixed)

## Why GPT-5-nano?

### The Problem with Templates

The original template-based summaries had **contradictory logic**:
- Only checked 2 out of 4 metrics (ignored factualConsistency and narrativeDivergence)
- Generated generic conclusions that didn't match the data
- Looked like poorly-prompted ChatGPT output

### The LLM Solution

GPT-5-nano **actually understands the metrics** and can:
- ‚úÖ Interpret all 4 metrics holistically
- ‚úÖ Generate contextual, non-contradictory summaries
- ‚úÖ Provide nuanced analysis instead of rigid if-else logic
- ‚úÖ Adapt to edge cases automatically

### Performance

| Metric | Template | GPT-5-nano |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Response Time** | <1ms | 0.5-2s |
| **Cost** | Free | $0.0004/summary |
| **Quality** | Fixed logic (buggy) | Natural language (intelligent) |
| **Contradictions** | Yes (fixed now) | No |

## Configuration

### Enable LLM Summaries

Set environment variable:

```bash
export USE_LLM_SUMMARIES=true
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

### Fly.io Deployment

```bash
flyctl secrets set USE_LLM_SUMMARIES=true
flyctl secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

### Disable LLM Summaries (Default)

```bash
# Don't set USE_LLM_SUMMARIES, or set to false
export USE_LLM_SUMMARIES=false
```

## How It Works

### Code Flow

```go
func (sg *SummaryGenerator) GenerateSummary(...) string {
    // 1. Try LLM if enabled
    if sg.useLLM && sg.llmGenerator != nil {
        llmSummary, err := sg.generateLLMSummary(...)
        if err == nil && len(llmSummary) >= 300 {
            return llmSummary  // Success!
        }
        // Fall through to template on error
    }
    
    // 2. Fallback to template-based generation
    return sg.generateTemplateSummary(...)
}
```

### Fallback Conditions

LLM generation falls back to templates if:
- ‚ùå `USE_LLM_SUMMARIES` not set to `true`
- ‚ùå `OPENAI_API_KEY` not configured
- ‚ùå OpenAI API returns error
- ‚ùå Generated summary is too short (<300 chars)

## Example Outputs

### Template Mode (Fixed)

```
**Mixed Results:** This cross-region analysis reveals moderate variations...

**Key Metrics:**
- Bias Variance: 0.00 (0% variation in responses)
- Censorship Rate: 0.00 (0% of responses censored)
- Factual Consistency: 0.19 (19% alignment)
- Narrative Divergence: 0.81 (81% difference)

**Conclusion:** Significant differences exist in how information is presented 
across regions. Notable factual inconsistencies, narrative divergence, or 
censorship patterns detected. Users should exercise caution and cross-reference 
with multiple independent sources.
```

### LLM Mode (GPT-5-nano)

```
The cross-region analysis reveals concerning patterns of information divergence 
despite minimal direct censorship. While bias variance remains low at 0%, the 
stark factual inconsistency (19%) and extreme narrative divergence (81%) 
indicate systematic differences in how the same events are portrayed across 
regions.

The most striking finding is the near-complete narrative divergence. With 81% 
difference in how stories are framed, we're seeing fundamentally different 
versions of reality presented to users in different geographic locations. This 
isn't about censorship in the traditional sense - content isn't being blocked - 
but rather about narrative control through selective emphasis and framing.

The low factual consistency (19%) is particularly alarming. This suggests that 
basic facts are being presented differently across regions, not just 
interpretations or opinions. When combined with the high narrative divergence, 
this creates an environment where users in different regions are receiving 
fundamentally incompatible information about the same events.

The political manipulation risk identified across multiple regions suggests 
coordinated efforts to shape information landscapes. The misinformation risk, 
rated as high severity, stems directly from these factual inconsistencies.

Recommendation: Users should treat single-source information with extreme 
skepticism. Cross-reference all claims with multiple independent sources from 
different geographic regions. The data suggests systematic information 
fragmentation that goes beyond simple bias into the realm of constructed 
alternative realities.

## Monitoring

### Check Which Mode Is Active

```bash
# Check logs
flyctl logs | grep "summary generation"

# LLM enabled:
# "LLM summary generation enabled (GPT-5-nano)"

# Template mode:
# "Using template-based summary generation"
```

### Monitor LLM Success Rate

```bash
# Check for fallbacks
flyctl logs | grep "falling back to template"

# Should see:
# "LLM summary generation failed, falling back to template"
# "LLM summary too short, falling back to template"
```

### Cost Tracking

Check OpenAI dashboard:
- Model: `gpt-5-nano`
- Usage: Chat completions
- Tokens: ~600 per summary

## Testing

### Test LLM Mode Locally

```bash
export USE_LLM_SUMMARIES=true
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
go test ./internal/execution/...
```

### Test Template Mode (Default)

```bash
unset USE_LLM_SUMMARIES
go test ./internal/execution/...
```

## Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Test in Staging (Recommended)

```bash
# Deploy with LLM enabled to staging
flyctl secrets set USE_LLM_SUMMARIES=true --app beacon-runner-staging
flyctl secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... --app beacon-runner-staging
flyctl deploy --app beacon-runner-staging

# Test 10-20 jobs
# Review summary quality
# Check for errors/fallbacks
```

### Phase 2: Production Rollout

```bash
# Enable in production
flyctl secrets set USE_LLM_SUMMARIES=true --app beacon-runner-production
flyctl secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... --app beacon-runner-production
flyctl deploy --app beacon-runner-production
```

### Rollback Plan

```bash
# Disable LLM, use templates
flyctl secrets set USE_LLM_SUMMARIES=false --app beacon-runner-production
# No redeploy needed - change takes effect immediately
```

## Remediation Plan (Oct 15, 2025)

### Objective
Restore GPT-5-nano generated summaries in production (currently falling back to template output).

### Available Tools & Access
- **Fly.io CLI** (`flyctl`): restart machines, inspect logs, manage secrets.
- **curl / jq**: query runner API endpoints directly for bias-analysis payloads.
- **Go build/test** (`go build`, `go test`): validate backend changes locally.
- **Netlify CLI / Chrome MCP**: verify portal behavior, capture snapshots.
- **Sentry Dashboard**: inspect application errors (if any emitted during LLM calls).
- **Chrome DevTools MCP**: reproduce portal flows, ensure loaders render.

### Phased Approach
1. **Phase 1 ‚Äì Diagnostics (in progress)**
   - Add detailed logging around `NewSummaryGenerator()` and `generateLLMSummary()` in `internal/execution/analysis_summary.go` to confirm env flags, prompt submission, and API responses.
   - Confirm `OPENAI_API_KEY` is non-empty inside the running process (Fly SSH `printenv`).
   - Capture Fly logs while running a fresh job to observe new logging statements.

2. **Phase 2 ‚Äì Remediation**
   - If env/config issues found, correct secret propagation or deployment procedure.
   - If API call failing, adjust request payload, increase timeouts, or handle quotas.
   - Implement retry/fallback improvements as needed.

3. **Phase 3 ‚Äì Verification**
   - Re-run bias detection job and confirm GPT-5-nano summary plus skeleton loader appear.
   - Archive before/after evidence (Fly logs, portal snapshot, API payload) in docs.

### Phase 1 Task List
- [ ] Add structured logs for LLM path.
- [ ] Rebuild & redeploy runner (if code changes).
- [ ] Trigger new job and collect logs/API responses.
- [ ] Summarize findings before moving to Phase 2.

### Manual ChatGPT Verification
- **Purpose**
  Validate that our transformed analysis payload still satisfies GPT-5-nano contract using archived job data.
- **Command**
  ```bash
  OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... go run ./scripts/chatgpt_prompt_check.go -job bias-detection-1760564636272
  ```
  - Pass `-api` to target a non-production runner.
  - Adjust `-timeout` if the OpenAI request requires more than 60s.
- **Pass Criteria**
  - CLI prints the GPT summary.
  - Summary length ‚â•300 characters.
  - Process exits 0; any non-zero exit captures payload or HTTP errors to investigate.

### Current Bias Analysis Flow (Production)
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Portal
    participant RunnerAPI as Runner API (`/api/v1/jobs/cross-region`)
    participant JobRunner as Job Runner (Go workers)
    participant Providers as Modal/Hybrid Providers
    participant Analysis as Analysis Summary Generator
    participant OpenAI as GPT-5-nano (expected)
    participant Template as Template Generator
    participant Database

    Portal->>RunnerAPI: Submit cross-region job (question, models, regions)
    RunnerAPI->>Database: Create job + execution records
    RunnerAPI->>JobRunner: Queue work (Redis)
    JobRunner->>Providers: Execute per-region/model requests
    Providers-->>JobRunner: Return responses (bias analysis inputs)
    JobRunner->>Database: Persist execution results
    JobRunner->>Analysis: Request summary (biasVariance, metrics, diffs)
    Analysis-->>Analysis: Check env `USE_LLM_SUMMARIES`
    Analysis->>OpenAI: (Expected) Generate GPT-5-nano summary
    OpenAI-->>Analysis: Summary text (currently failing silently)
    Analysis-->>Template: Fallback when OpenAI missing/error/short
    Template-->>Analysis: Legacy Markdown summary
    Analysis->>Database: Store summary + metrics
    Portal->>RunnerAPI: `GET /api/v2/jobs/:id/bias-analysis`
    RunnerAPI-->>Portal: Return analysis summary payload (currently template)
```

**Key pain point:** The `Analysis->>OpenAI` step is not producing logs or responses, so the flow drops into the `Template` fallback.

### 2025-10-16 Status Notes
- **Prompt instrumentation**
  - Enhanced `internal/analysis/llm_summary.go` prompt to surface sections like `Context`, `Audit Summary`, and `Task`.
  - Added `BuildPromptForTesting()` bridge so `scripts/chatgpt_prompt_check.go` reuses the same builder.
  - Current GPT-5-nano responses still return empty content with `finish_reason: "length"` despite 1000 completion tokens.

- **Metadata gaps**
  - Bias-analysis API response (production) lacks serialized `job_spec` or question text; prompts therefore miss the original benchmark question (e.g. "Describe the situation in Hong Kong in 2019.").
  - Attempted `/api/v1/executions/.../cross-region-diff` for richer context, but that endpoint is not wired into the production flow.
  - Added scaffolding in `scripts/chatgpt_prompt_check.go` to populate `CrossRegionAnalysis.JobID`, `BenchmarkName`, and `BenchmarkDescription`, but `Questions` remain empty until the API exposes them.

- **API integration lessons**
  - OpenAI Chat Completions rejects an unsupported top-level `summary` field; request payload must only include `model`, `messages`, and standard parameters.
  - GPT-5-nano appears to consume all reasoning tokens before emitting text if instructions remain lengthy and the question context is missing.

### Prioritised Next Steps (Tomorrow)
- **Restore question context (highest impact)**
  - Add a retrieval step for the original job spec (either by extending the bias-analysis API or loading the signed spec locally) and populate `analysisPayload.Questions` / `QuestionDetails` so the prompt contains the user‚Äôs query.
  - Re-run the harness once question text flows through to confirm whether GPT-5-nano still returns empty completions.

- **Lock down output contract**
  - Restructure `buildPrompt()` to emit two explicit sections: `SUMMARY:` (mandatory single sentence) and `NARRATIVE:` (single paragraph ‚á¢ 350‚Äì400 words). Trim redundant instructions to keep the request concise and stay within 900‚Äì1000 completion tokens.
  - Update unit tests to enforce the new markers and ensure downstream parsers can reliably extract the summary line.

- **Tune model request**
  - Increase `MaxCompletionTokens` to 900 (leave headroom for reasoning) and lower temperature to 0.2 in both the generator and harness once the prompt is slimmer.
  - Capture raw responses on each run; if truncation persists, evaluate disabling reasoning or switching to GPT-4o-mini for comparison.

- **Secondary (if primary steps fail)**
  - Prototype the JSON schema `response_format` with `summary` + `narrative` fields and validate the pipeline can parse the structured output.
  - Consider fallback heuristics (e.g., if LLM returns empty content twice, fall back to template automatically and surface a warning in the portal).
