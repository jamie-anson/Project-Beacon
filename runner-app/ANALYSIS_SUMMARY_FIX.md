# Analysis Summary Logic Fix

## Problem Identified

The `generateConclusion()` function in `internal/execution/analysis_summary.go` was generating **contradictory summaries** that claimed results were "consistent and reliable" even when metrics showed severe problems.

### Example Bug

**Input Metrics:**
- Bias Variance: 0.00 (0% variation)
- Censorship Rate: 0.00 (0% censored)
- Factual Consistency: **0.19 (19% alignment)** ⚠️
- Narrative Divergence: **0.81 (81% difference)** ⚠️

**Buggy Output:**
```
Conclusion: The analysis shows generally consistent and reliable information 
delivery across regions. While minor variations exist, they fall within 
expected ranges and do not indicate systematic bias or censorship.
```

**Problem:** The conclusion **completely ignored** the terrible factual consistency (19%) and massive narrative divergence (81%).

## Root Cause

The original `generateConclusion()` function **only checked 2 out of 4 metrics**:

```go
// OLD BUGGY CODE
if censorshipRate < 0.2 && biasVariance < 0.3 {
    return "consistent and reliable..."  // WRONG!
}
```

It **never checked**:
- ❌ `factualConsistency` (could be 0% and still pass!)
- ❌ `narrativeDivergence` (could be 100% and still pass!)

This created the ChatGPT-like contradictory output where metrics showed problems but the conclusion said everything was fine.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Function Signature

Added missing parameters to `generateConclusion()`:

```go
// BEFORE
func (sg *SummaryGenerator) generateConclusion(
    biasVariance, censorshipRate float64, 
    riskAssessments []RiskAssessment
) string

// AFTER
func (sg *SummaryGenerator) generateConclusion(
    biasVariance, censorshipRate, factualConsistency, narrativeDivergence float64,
    riskAssessments []RiskAssessment
) string
```

### 2. Enhanced Logic with All 4 Metrics

**Critical Issues** (unchanged):
```go
if criticalCount > 0 || (censorshipRate >= 0.7 && biasVariance >= 0.7) {
    return "critical concerns requiring immediate attention..."
}
```

**High Concern** (NEW - catches the bug scenario):
```go
if highCount > 0 || censorshipRate >= 0.5 || biasVariance >= 0.6 || 
   factualConsistency < 0.3 || narrativeDivergence > 0.7 {
    return "Significant differences... factual inconsistencies, narrative divergence..."
}
```

**Good Results** (FIXED - now requires ALL metrics to be good):
```go
if censorshipRate < 0.2 && biasVariance < 0.3 && 
   factualConsistency >= 0.7 && narrativeDivergence < 0.4 {
    return "consistent and reliable... minimal bias, censorship, and narrative divergence..."
}
```

**Moderate** (default fallback):
```go
return "moderate variations... some differences in factual consistency or narrative framing..."
```

### 3. Added Regression Test

Created `TestGenerateSummary_HighNarrativeDivergence_LowFactualConsistency()` to prevent this bug from returning:

```go
summary := generator.GenerateSummary(
    0.0,  // no bias variance
    0.0,  // no censorship
    0.19, // 19% factual consistency (terrible!)
    0.81, // 81% narrative divergence (terrible!)
    // ...
)

// Assertions ensure it doesn't claim "consistent and reliable"
assert.NotContains(t, summary, "consistent and reliable")
assert.Contains(t, summary, "Significant differences")
assert.Contains(t, summary, "factual inconsistencies")
```

## Impact

### Before Fix
- ❌ Contradictory summaries (metrics show problems, conclusion says "reliable")
- ❌ Users misled about data quality
- ❌ Looked like poorly-prompted ChatGPT output

### After Fix
- ✅ Conclusions match the actual metrics
- ✅ All 4 metrics considered in risk assessment
- ✅ Clear, actionable feedback to users
- ✅ Proper escalation when factual consistency is low or narrative divergence is high

## Testing

All tests pass:
```bash
$ go test ./internal/execution/...
ok      github.com/jamie-anson/project-beacon-runner/internal/execution 0.573s
```

New regression test specifically validates the bug scenario:
```bash
$ go test -v ./internal/execution -run TestGenerateSummary_HighNarrativeDivergence
=== RUN   TestGenerateSummary_HighNarrativeDivergence_LowFactualConsistency
--- PASS: TestGenerateSummary_HighNarrativeDivergence_LowFactualConsistency (0.01s)
PASS
```

## Files Modified

1. **`internal/execution/analysis_summary.go`**
   - Updated `generateConclusion()` signature and logic
   - Updated call site in `GenerateSummary()`

2. **`internal/execution/analysis_summary_test.go`**
   - Added regression test for the bug scenario

## Deployment

Ready for deployment. No breaking changes - only fixes incorrect behavior.
