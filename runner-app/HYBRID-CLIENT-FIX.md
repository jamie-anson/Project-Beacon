# CRITICAL BUG FIX: Hybrid Client Not Initialized

**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Severity:** CRITICAL (100% job failure rate)  
**Commit:** `76cef0a`

---

## Problem

All jobs were failing immediately (<100ms) with no output data:

```
Job: bias-detection-1761127327315
- 6 executions (3 models × 2 regions)
- All failed within 18-80ms
- All executions: status="failed", output_data=null, receipt_data=null
- No network calls made to hybrid router
```

---

## Root Cause

**File:** `cmd/runner/main.go` lines 243, 246

**Bug:** Direct field assignment instead of using setter method:

```go
// WRONG (what we had):
jr.Hybrid = hybrid.New(base)

// CORRECT (what we need):
jr.SetHybridClient(hybrid.New(base))
```

**Why this matters:**

The `SetHybridClient()` method does TWO things:
1. Sets `jr.Hybrid` field
2. **Sets `jr.Executor` field** ← This was missing!

```go
// internal/worker/job_runner.go lines 91-96
func (w *JobRunner) SetHybridClient(client *hybrid.Client) {
    w.Hybrid = client
    if client != nil {
        w.Executor = NewHybridExecutor(client)  // ← CRITICAL!
    }
}
```

Without `w.Executor` set, the executor check fails:

```go
// internal/worker/executor_hybrid.go lines 136-138
if h.Client == nil {
    return "", "failed", nil, nil, fmt.Errorf("hybrid client not configured")
}
```

## Impact

**Before Fix:**
- ✅ `jr.Hybrid` was set (client existed)
- ❌ `jr.Executor` was nil (executor not initialized)
- ❌ Executor check failed immediately
- ❌ No inference calls made
- ❌ 100% job failure rate

**After Fix:**
- ✅ `jr.Hybrid` is set
- ✅ `jr.Executor` is set
- ✅ Executor check passes
- ✅ Inference calls proceed normally
- ✅ Jobs execute successfully

---

## The Fix

**Changed:** `cmd/runner/main.go` lines 243, 246

```diff
- jr.Hybrid = hybrid.New(base)
+ jr.SetHybridClient(hybrid.New(base))

- jr.Hybrid = hybrid.New("")
+ jr.SetHybridClient(hybrid.New(""))
```

---

## Verification

1. **Code Flow:**
   ```
   main.go:243 → jr.SetHybridClient()
                 ↓
   job_runner.go:91-96 → Sets w.Hybrid AND w.Executor
                         ↓
   job_runner.go:256-260 → Finds executor
                           ↓
   executor_hybrid.go:136 → Client check passes ✅
                            ↓
   Inference proceeds normally
   ```

2. **Expected Behavior:**
   - Jobs will execute through hybrid router
   - Network calls to Railway router will succeed
   - Output data and receipts will be captured
   - Normal execution times (~80s per inference)

## Deployment

**Commit:** `76cef0a`  
**Pushed to:** `main` branch  
**Auto-deploy:** Fly.io will pick up changes automatically

**Monitor:**
- Submit test job after deployment
- Verify executions complete successfully
- Check output_data is populated
- Confirm normal execution times

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always use setter methods** when they exist - they do more than just field assignment
2. **Test initialization paths** - verify all required fields are set
3. **Check for nil executors** - add validation in job runner startup
4. **Add integration tests** - catch initialization bugs before production
