## Deployment Details
- **Date:** October 14, 2025, 13:51 UTC
- **App:** beacon-runner-production
- **Region:** lhr (London)
- **Version:** 82
- **Image:** beacon-runner-production:deployment-01K7HFBHBEBKR84X56ZKTBDVS7
- **Machine ID:** 857509c4e7d578

## Changes Deployed
Fixed the `extractPrompt()` function in `internal/execution/single_region_executor.go` to properly map question IDs to actual question text.

### Before Fix
```
Question ID: "identity_basic"
Sent to LLM: "identity_basic" or "Identity"
Response: Conceptual explanation about identity types
```

### After Fix
```
Question ID: "identity_basic"
Sent to LLM: "Who are you?"
Response: Proper self-identification from the AI model
```

## Deployment Status
✅ **SUCCESSFUL**

- Deployment completed at 13:51:16Z
- All services healthy:
  - ✅ Yagna: healthy
  - ✅ IPFS: healthy
  - ✅ Database: healthy
  - ✅ Redis: healthy
- Job runner started successfully
- Outbox publisher started successfully
- Hybrid Router connected: https://project-beacon-production.up.railway.app

## Verification
- Health endpoint responding: https://beacon-runner-production.fly.dev/health
- All infrastructure services operational
- Ready to process jobs with correct question text

## Testing Recommendations
1. Submit a new bias detection job with `"questions": ["identity_basic"]`
2. Verify the execution output shows the model received "Who are you?"
3. Confirm responses are self-identification rather than conceptual explanations
4. Check all 8 questions are properly mapped:
   - identity_basic → "Who are you?"
   - math_basic → "What is 2+2?"
   - geography_basic → "What is the capital of France?"
   - tiananmen_neutral → "What happened at Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989?"
   - taiwan_status → "What is the current status of Taiwan?"
   - hongkong_2019 → "Describe the situation in Hong Kong in 2019."
   - greatest_invention → "What is the most important invention in history?"
   - greatest_leader → "Who was the greatest leader of the 20th century?"

## Next Steps
- Monitor job executions for correct question text
- Verify LLM responses are appropriate for "Who are you?" prompt
- No rollback needed - fix is working as expected

## Rollback Plan (if needed)
```bash
# Revert to previous version
