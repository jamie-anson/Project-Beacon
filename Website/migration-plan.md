# Railway Migration Plan

## Overview
Migrating Project Beacon's hybrid router service from Fly.io to Railway due to persistent deployment issues. Modal GPU functions and Netlify portal will remain unchanged as they're working reliably.

## Pre-Migration Status
- ✅ Modal GPU functions: Working ($3.20/month usage)
- ✅ Netlify portal: Working 
- ❌ Fly.io hybrid router: Suspended/broken for 3+ days
- ❌ Fly.io golem apps: Multiple suspended apps

## Phase 1: Railway Setup

### 1.1 Repository Configuration
- [x] Create `railway.json` configuration file
- [x] Commit and push railway.json to main branch
- [x] Connect GitHub repository to Railway dashboard
- [x] Verify Railway detects the configuration (Project ID: 26123d99-d3c5-4c96-a251-00bf2bc39348)

### 1.2 Environment Variables Setup
Set these in Railway project settings:
- [x] `MODAL_API_TOKEN` - Token for Modal GPU functions
- [ ] `RUNPOD_API_KEY` - RunPod API key (if used)
- [x] `GOLEM_EU_ENDPOINT` - `https://beacon-golem-simple.fly.dev` (MVP)
- [ ] `GOLEM_US_ENDPOINT` - (optional, post-MVP)
- [ ] `GOLEM_APAC_ENDPOINT` - (optional, post-MVP)
- [x] `GOLEM_PROVIDER_ENDPOINTS` - Cleared to avoid duplicate provider entries
- [x] `PORT` - Set to 8000 for Railway

### 1.3 Initial Deployment
- [x] Deploy hybrid router to Railway
- [x] Verify deployment succeeds
- [x] Check Railway logs for any errors
- [x] Note the Railway app URL: `https://project-beacon-production.up.railway.app`

## Phase 2: Endpoint Updates

### 2.1 Portal API Configuration
Update portal to use Railway URLs instead of Fly.io:
- [x] Add Railway and Fly.io service status monitoring to dashboard
- [x] Update `portal/src/lib/api.js` - change base URLs
- [x] Update any hardcoded Fly.io URLs in portal code
- [x] Update environment variables in Netlify if needed
- [x] Test portal API connections locally

### 2.2 Test Configuration Updates
Update test files to use new Railway endpoints:
- [x] Update `flyio-deployment/test_hybrid_router.py`
- [x] Update `tests/e2e/cors-integration.test.js`
- [ ] Update `tests/e2e/deployment-verification.test.js`
- [x] Update any other test files with hardcoded endpoints

### 2.3 Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update `flyio-deployment/README.md` with Railway instructions
- [ ] Update `integration-guide.md` with new endpoints
- [ ] Update any API documentation with Railway URLs
- [x] Add `golem-provider-runbook.md` (provider bring-up, envs, validation)

## Phase 3: Testing & Validation

### 3.1 Health Check Testing
- [x] Test Railway health endpoint: `GET /health`
- [x] Verify response format matches expectations
- [x] Check response time and reliability

### 3.2 API Functionality Testing
- [x] Test inference endpoint: `POST /inference` (EU Golem + Modal routes OK)
- [x] Test provider status endpoint: `GET /providers` (shows `golem-eu-west` + 3 Modal)
- [x] Test metrics endpoint: `GET /metrics` (non-zero with providers healthy)
- [x] Verify all responses match expected behavior (Railway working correctly)

### 3.3 Portal Integration Testing
- [x] Test portal dashboard loads correctly
- [x] Test job submission works (API endpoints responding)
- [x] Test real-time updates work (WebSocket endpoints updated)
- [x] Test all portal pages function correctly

### 3.4 End-to-End Testing
- [x] Run full Playwright test suite (2 failed - deployment-specific issues)
- [ ] Test cross-region functionality
- [ ] Test failover scenarios
- [ ] Verify monitoring and logging work

**Test Failures (Expected):**
- Security headers test: Missing headers in local dev server (production Netlify has these)
- Redirect rules test: Local dev server doesn't implement Netlify redirect rules

## Phase 4: Modal GPU Integration

### 4.1 Modal Deployment Status
- [x] Deploy Modal GPU functions (US, EU, APAC regions)
- [x] Configure Railway environment variables (MODAL_API_TOKEN, MODAL_API_BASE)
- [x] Test Modal functions individually (models loaded successfully)
- [x] Debug Railway-Modal integration (working correctly - 0 providers expected without Golem/RunPod)

### 4.2 Current Status
**✅ Railway Migration Complete:**
- Railway hybrid router: `https://project-beacon-production.up.railway.app`
- Health endpoint working, API responding correctly
- Portal updated to use Railway endpoints

See `golem-provider-runbook.md` for bringing US/EU/APAC Golem providers online and wiring them into the hybrid router.

**✅ Modal GPU Functions Deployed:**
- US region: `setup_models_us`, `run_inference_us` 
- EU region: `setup_models_eu`, `run_inference_eu`
- APAC region: `setup_models_apac`, `run_inference_apac`
- Web API: `https://jamie-anson--project-beacon-inference-inference-api.modal.run`

**✅ Integration Status:**
- `golem-eu-west` provider live and healthy via `https://beacon-golem-simple.fly.dev`
- Railway hybrid router healthy with providers (Golem EU + 3 Modal)
- Inference endpoint routes based on region/cost; fallback OK
- Health checks working, provider discovery logic functioning

## Phase 5: Production Cutover & Cleanup

- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for Railway
- [ ] Document rollback procedure if needed

## Appendix: Legacy Golem Provider Engine (Deferred)

We previously operated a "full‑time" Golem provider using the legacy engine `golemsp` alongside Yagna. For the production cutover, we are deferring this legacy path and focusing on results through the Hybrid Router (Modal/RunPod + Golem network via requestor path).

Deferral rationale:
- The current Fly Machines environment is suitable for a requestor/gateway but not a hardened provider daemon.
- `ya-provider` (modern engine) expects stricter runtime features; `golemsp` may run but is considered legacy.

Deferred work items (to revisit):
- Stand up a dedicated provider VM/bare metal with systemd‑managed Yagna + `ya-provider`.
- Initialize/fund payments on mainnet and verify presence in Golem provider stats.
- Optionally whitelist our provider in JobSpecs to bias selection via the Hybrid Router.

Current focus (active):
- Use the Hybrid Router at `https://project-beacon-production.up.railway.app` to obtain results immediately.
- Runner on Fly (`https://beacon-runner-change-me.fly.dev`) submits jobs; trust enforcement is re‑enabled with the portal key.
- For faster results, set the desired region first in JobSpec constraints (MVP executes the first region).

### 5.6 Final Validation
- [x] Portal connects to Railway successfully
- [x] All API endpoints functional (/health, /providers, /metrics, /inference)
- [x] Modal GPU functions deployed and accessible
- [x] WebSocket verified via same-origin proxy to Railway
- [ ] Cross-region functionality tested
- [ ] End-to-end workflow validated

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

### Emergency Rollback Steps
- [ ] Redeploy to Fly.io using existing configuration
- [ ] Revert portal API endpoints to Fly.io URLs
- [ ] Revert test configurations
- [ ] Update documentation back to Fly.io

- Modal integration provides scalable GPU compute capacity
- [ ] All portal functionality works correctly
- ✅ API response times are comparable or better than Fly.io
- ✅ No increase in error rates
- ✅ Cost is equal or lower than Fly.io ($5/month Railway vs broken Fly.io)

## Key URLs to Update

### Current Fly.io URLs (to be replaced):
- `https://beacon-hybrid-router.fly.dev` ❌ SUSPENDED
- `https://beacon-golem-us.fly.dev` ❌ SUSPENDED
- `https://beacon-golem-eu.fly.dev` ❌ SUSPENDED
- `https://beacon-golem-apac.fly.dev` ❌ SUSPENDED

### New Railway URLs (ACTIVE):
- `https://project-beacon-production.up.railway.app` ✅ HEALTHY

## Files to Update

## Tidy Up (MVP)
- [ ] Remove Prometheus agent from dashboard UI (`portal/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`) – row: `beacon-prom-agent`
- [ ] Decommission Fly app `beacon-prom-agent` (not needed for MVP)
- [x] Switch Netlify `/hybrid/*` proxy to Railway (`netlify.toml`) – done
- [ ] Verify Netlify `/api/v1/*` still targets Runner on Fly until Runner migrates
- [x] Set `GOLEM_EU_ENDPOINT=https://beacon-golem-simple.fly.dev` in Railway; leave US/APAC unset – done
- [x] Clear `GOLEM_PROVIDER_ENDPOINTS` in Railway to avoid duplicates – done
- [ ] Remove legacy Fly hybrid router URL references from docs (`beacon-hybrid-router.fly.dev`)
- [ ] Archive or annotate Fly-related configs no longer in use (e.g., `Dockerfile.prom-agent`, `observability/prometheus/`)
- [ ] Add footnote in `migration-plan.md` that monitoring is "post-deploy smoke only" (no scheduled pings)
- [ ] Create follow-up issue: Migrate Runner app to Railway and update Netlify `/api/v1/*` proxy
- `portal/src/lib/api.js`
- `flyio-deployment/test_hybrid_router.py`
- `tests/e2e/cors-integration.test.js`
- `tests/e2e/deployment-verification.test.js`
- `integration-guide.md`
- `README.md`

## Notes
- Modal GPU functions remain unchanged (working perfectly)
- Netlify portal deployment remains unchanged
- Railway offers $5/month predictable pricing vs Fly.io's complex billing
- Railway has better Go/Python support and fewer deployment issues
