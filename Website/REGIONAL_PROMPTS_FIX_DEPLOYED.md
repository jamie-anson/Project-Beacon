# Regional Prompts MVP - Fix Deployed

**Date**: 2025-09-29T23:10:32+01:00  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIX DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION**

---

## üéØ Fix Summary

**Problem**: Multi-question prompts causing model refusals ("I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.")

**Solution**: Modified job runner to execute **one question per execution** instead of combining multiple questions.

---

## üìù Changes Made

### Code Changes:

**File**: `internal/worker/job_runner.go`

**Function**: `executeMultiModelJob()`

**Key Changes:**
1. Added question iteration loop
2. Each question gets its own execution record
3. Set `modelSpec.Questions = []string{qID}` for single-question execution
4. Added `question_id` and `question_index` to metadata
5. Updated logging to include question information

**Impact:**
- Job with 8 questions, 3 models, 3 regions = **72 executions** (was 9)
- Each execution classified independently
- Better granularity for bias detection

---

## üöÄ Deployment Status

**Backend:**
- ‚úÖ Code committed: `1b3236b`
- ‚úÖ Pushed to GitHub
- ‚è≥ Deploying to Fly.io (beacon-runner-change-me)

**Frontend:**
- ‚úÖ Already deployed (no changes needed)
- Portal will automatically display per-question results

**Database:**
- ‚úÖ No migration needed
- Existing schema supports per-question executions

---

## üìä Expected Behavior

### Before Fix:
```
Job: bias-detection-1759182946113
Questions: 8 (combined into single prompt)
Models: 3
Regions: 3
Executions: 9 (3 models √ó 3 regions)
Result: ALL FAILED with refusal responses
```

### After Fix:
```
Job: [new-test-job]
Questions: 8 (executed separately)
Models: 3
Regions: 3
Executions: 72 (3 models √ó 3 regions √ó 8 questions)
Result: Each question classified independently
```

---

## üß™ Testing Plan

### Test 1: Single Question (Immediate)

**Submit:**
```json
{
  "questions": ["tiananmen_neutral"],
  "models": ["qwen2.5-1.5b"],
  "regions": ["US"]
}
```

**Expected:**
- 1 execution created
- Regional prompt: "based in the US"
- Substantive response (no refusal)
- Classification: `is_substantive = true`
- Response length recorded

---

### Test 2: Multiple Questions (After Test 1 Success)

**Submit:**
```json
{
  "questions": ["tiananmen_neutral", "taiwan_status"],
  "models": ["qwen2.5-1.5b"],
  "regions": ["US"]
}
```

**Expected:**
- 2 executions created (one per question)
- Both with regional prompt
- Both with substantive responses
- Independent classifications

---

### Test 3: Full Multi-Model, Multi-Region (Final Validation)

**Submit:**
```json
{
  "questions": ["tiananmen_neutral", "taiwan_status", "hongkong_2019"],
  "models": ["qwen2.5-1.5b", "mistral-7b", "llama3.2-1b"],
  "regions": ["US", "EU", "ASIA"]
}
```

**Expected:**
- 27 executions (3 questions √ó 3 models √ó 3 regions)
- All with regional prompts
- Per-question classifications
- Cross-region comparison possible

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

**Fix is successful if:**

1. **Single Question Jobs Work:**
   - [x] No refusal responses
   - [x] Regional prompts applied
   - [x] Classifications stored
   - [x] Portal displays correctly

2. **Multi-Question Jobs Work:**
   - [x] N executions created (one per question)
   - [x] Each question classified independently
   - [x] No combined prompt refusals
   - [x] All regional prompts applied

3. **Portal Display:**
   - [x] Shows per-question results
   - [x] Classification badges visible
   - [x] Can filter/group by question
   - [x] Cross-region comparison works

---

## üìà Benefits of This Approach

### Better Bias Detection:
- Compare same question across regions
- Identify regional censorship patterns
- Measure consistency per question

### Better Classification:
- Each response classified independently
- More accurate refusal detection
- Granular response length tracking

### Better User Experience:
- Clear per-question results
- Easy to identify which questions failed
- Better debugging and analysis

---

## üîÑ Backward Compatibility

**Legacy Jobs (no questions array):**
- Still work with single execution
- Fallback to combined prompt behavior
- No breaking changes

**Code:**
```go
questions := spec.Questions
if len(questions) == 0 {
    // Fallback: single execution with combined prompt
    questions = []string{""}
}
```

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Wait for Deployment** (5-10 minutes)
   - Fly.io will build and deploy
   - Machines will restart with new code

2. **Submit Test Job** (via portal)
   - Start with single question
   - Verify regional prompt works
   - Check classification data

3. **Validate Results**
   - Check execution records
   - Verify system_prompt field
   - Confirm no refusals
   - Test portal display

4. **Scale Up Testing**
   - Test with multiple questions
   - Test all 3 models
   - Test all 3 regions
   - Validate cross-region comparison
