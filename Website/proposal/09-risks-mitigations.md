title: Risks & Mitigations
---

## Technical Risks

**GPU/CPU Task Separation Challenge**
- **Risk**: Limited provider availability for specialized GPU tasks due to high NVIDIA hardware costs and providers not configured for Project Beacon workloads
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Hybrid infrastructure approach combining Golem with Modal/RunPod for GPU tasks
  - CPU-focused tasks prioritized for Golem network (repeated results, verification tasks)
  - Provider onboarding program with clear setup documentation and incentives

**Compute Variability Across Providers/Regions**
- **Risk**: Inconsistent results due to hardware differences and regional variations
- **Mitigation**: Deterministic seeds, multiple trials, quorum rules, and standardized container environments

## Execution Risks

**Speed of Execution & Academic Calendar Alignment**
- **Risk**: Missing critical university term start periods (September-October) for student engagement
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Proactive outreach beginning of each academic term
  - Flexible project timelines accommodating academic schedules
  - Multiple university partnerships to spread risk across different calendars

**Solo Founder Capacity**
- **Risk**: Project complexity exceeding single-person execution capability
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Phased approach with clear milestone gates
  - Early identification of critical team expansion needs
  - Academic partnerships providing student developer resources

## Financial Risks

**International Scaling Costs**
- **Risk**: High costs associated with achieving international significance (conferences like UK AI Safety Summit, travel, global presence)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Staged international expansion based on proven local success
  - Strategic partnership development to share costs and amplify reach
  - Grant funding specifically targeted at international conference participation
  - Virtual-first approach with selective high-impact in-person events

**University Partnership Costs**
- **Risk**: Universities demanding payment for student/lecturer access
- **Mitigation**: Long-term personal connections providing informal access pathways and relationship-based negotiations

## Community & Adoption Risks

**Token Speculation Distraction**
- **Risk**: Community focus shifting to Project Beacon token speculation rather than research objectives
- **Mitigation**:
  - Clear communication that no token is planned or relevant to project goals
  - Academic-first community building focused on research value
  - Moderation policies preventing speculative discussions in community channels

**Regulatory Overreach**
- **Risk**: Excessive compliance requirements limiting AI bias research capabilities
- **Mitigation**: Project's core mission aligns with transparency and accountability - regulatory challenges become validation of project importance rather than obstacles

## Dependency & Infrastructure Risks

**Dependency Drift**
- **Risk**: Container and software version inconsistencies affecting reproducibility
- **Mitigation**: Container pinning, version locks, Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs)

**Provider Availability**
- **Risk**: Golem network or hybrid infrastructure downtime
- **Mitigation**: Retries/backoff mechanisms, regional failover, result caching, multi-provider redundancy
