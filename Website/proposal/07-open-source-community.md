## Open Source Strategy

**Licensing:**
- Code repositories: Apache-2.0 or MIT (to be determined based on ecosystem compatibility)
- Datasets: CC-BY for attribution of research contributions
- All repositories public from project inception with comprehensive contribution guidelines and CI/CD

**Community Engagement:**

**Academic & Research Focus:**
- Target university students (3rd year projects) and PhD researchers
- Provide project ideas that offer practical value for career portfolios
- Focus on Imperial College London blockchain department with referrals to AI department
- Expand to other universities and AI safety centers for in-person engagement

**Communication Channels:**
- Telegram groups for community coordination (timezone-flexible)
- 1:1 sessions with researchers for personalized guidance
- Video content for general supporters and broader audience
- In-person events at universities and AI safety centers

**Value Proposition for Contributors:**
- Showcase-worthy projects for future employment opportunities
- Access to cutting-edge decentralized AI infrastructure
- Contribution to nationally/internationally significant AI transparency research
- Hands-on experience with distributed computing and blockchain technologies

**Ecosystem Contributions:**
- Mac version of Yagna development (expanding use case beyond current limitations)
- GPU/CPU task separation frameworks
- Focus on repeated results use cases (more valuable than single distributed inference)
- SDK examples and provider tooling for Golem ecosystem
- CI templates and best practices documentation

**Growth Strategy:**
- Quality over quantity approach - prioritizing national/international impact over user numbers
- Post-MVP trials will inform demand patterns and community needs
- Gradual expansion from academic base to broader research community
- Strategic partnerships with blockchain and AI research institutions
