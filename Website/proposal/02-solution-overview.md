title: Solution Overview (Project Beacon on Golem)
---

Core components:
- Runner orchestrating jobs across Golem providers/regions (Docker-packaged tasks).
- Benchmark suite for LLM behaviors (bias, filtering, output drift).
- Transparency layer: IPFS bundles, Merkle roots, proof endpoints, public verification.
- Portal UI for live activity, proofs, and community access.
- Attester monitoring product for real-time progress tracking.

Properties:
- Open-source first, verifiable, reproducible, auditable.
- Built for researchers and the general public; accessible evidence, not claims.

Why Golem:
- On-demand distributed compute; regional diversity; community of providers; payment rails; cost control.

## Solution Overview

Project Beacon leverages the Golem Network to address the challenges of AI transparency and bias detection through a decentralized, scalable, and verifiable solution.

### Core Components

- **Runner**: Orchestrates jobs across Golem providers and regions, utilizing Docker-packaged tasks to ensure consistency and reproducibility.
- **Benchmark Suite**: Evaluates LLM behaviors such as bias, filtering, and output drift, providing comprehensive insights into AI model performance.
- **Centralized AI Integration**: Enables users to query major AI services (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.) from any global location, capturing regional response variations and API behavior differences.
- **Transparency Layer**: Utilizes IPFS for bundling data, creating Merkle roots, and establishing proof endpoints, ensuring public verification and auditability of AI processes.
- **Portal UI**: Offers a user-friendly interface for live activity monitoring, proof access, and community engagement, fostering transparency and trust.
- **Attester Monitoring Product**: Provides attesters with tools to monitor progress in real-time, enhancing transparency and accountability throughout the project lifecycle.

### Key Properties

- **Open-Source**: Built with an open-source first approach, ensuring verifiability, reproducibility, and auditability.
- **Accessibility**: Designed for both researchers and the general public, providing accessible evidence rather than mere claims.

### Why Golem

- **Distributed Compute**: Offers on-demand, distributed compute resources with regional diversity, enhancing scalability and resilience.
- **Geographic Diversity**: Essential for capturing authentic regional variations in both decentralized (Golem) and centralized (ChatGPT/Gemini) AI services.
- **Community and Cost Control**: Supported by a vibrant community of providers, Golem ensures cost-effective solutions with robust payment rails.
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Enables comparison between decentralized AI execution (Golem) and centralized services, providing comprehensive transparency insights.
