## Risk Mitigation Timeline
- **Month 1**: vLLM APAC deployment and 3-region proof of concept validation (CRITICAL PATH)
- **Month 2**: CPU provider onboarding and template standardization; backup Modal/RunPod infrastructure
- **Month 3**: GPU upgrade path validation; community feedback integration
- **Month 4**: Multi-provider orchestration stability; government stakeholder engagement planning
- **Month 5**: International scaling preparation and conference submissions
- **Month 6**: Sustainability model validation and transition planning

## Technical Priorities

### Immediate (Weeks 1-3)
1. **vLLM APAC Deployment**: Fix region reliability to enable 3-region demos
2. **Proof of Concept Validation**: Demonstrate cross-region bias detection working end-to-end
3. **Performance Benchmarking**: Document latency, cost, and success rate improvements

### Short-term (Months 1-2)
1. **CPU Provider Template**: Standardize vLLM deployment for Golem providers
2. **Provider Onboarding**: Recruit and deploy 3-5 CPU providers across regions
3. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive provider deployment guides

### Medium-term (Months 2-4)
1. **vLLM Scale-Out**: Migrate all regions to vLLM infrastructure
2. **GPU Upgrade Path**: Enable premium tier for providers with GPU capacity
3. **Multi-Provider Orchestration**: Validate hybrid CPU/GPU routing and failover
