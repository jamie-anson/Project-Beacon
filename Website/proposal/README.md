## Key Highlights

### The Problem
- AI systems exhibit concerning bias, censorship, and policy drift
- Regional variations in AI behavior lack transparency
- No systematic tools for cross-regional AI evaluation
- Researchers and policymakers need verifiable data

### Our Solution
- **Decentralized benchmarking** on Golem Network across multiple regions
- **Cryptographic verification** with IPFS storage and Merkle proofs
- **Open datasets and tools** for research and policy communities
- **Real-time monitoring** through attester monitoring product

### Grant Request
- **Total Budget**: £3.1 million over 18 months
- **Phase 0** (Months 1-6): Core infrastructure - £1.2M
- **Phase 1** (Months 7-12): Multi-region deployment - £1.0M
- **Phase 2** (Months 13-18): Public pilot - £0.9M

### Expected Impact
- **For Golem**: Flagship application driving provider adoption
- **For Research**: First systematic cross-regional AI behavior dataset
- **For Society**: Increased AI accountability and transparency
- **For Policy**: Evidence-based AI governance and regulation

## Current Project Status

Project Beacon builds on substantial existing infrastructure:

- ✅ **Phase 3 Complete**: Multi-region hybrid infrastructure operational
- ✅ **LLM Benchmarks**: 3 containerized models with bias detection
- ✅ **Hybrid Routing**: Global serverless GPU capacity deployed
- ✅ **Provider Integration**: Ready for Golem mainnet deployment

```

## Key Differentiators

1. **Truly Decentralized**: No single point of control or censorship
2. **Cryptographically Verifiable**: Tamper-evident proofs for all results
3. **Geographic Diversity**: Authentic cross-regional comparisons
4. **Open Source**: All tools, datasets, and methodologies publicly available
5. **Academic Focus**: Built for researchers and policy communities
6. **Golem Integration**: Showcases real-world utility of decentralized compute

## Next Steps

1. **Grant Submission**: Submit to appropriate Golem grant program
2. **Community Engagement**: Connect with Golem community and providers
3. **Academic Outreach**: Build relationships with research institutions
4. **Provider Onboarding**: Expand Golem provider network for AI workloads
5. **Pilot Preparation**: Prepare for Phase 0 development kickoff
