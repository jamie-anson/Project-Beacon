## Problem Statement

Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly integral to decision-making processes across industries. However, the opacity of AI models leads to undetected biases, regional censorship, and policy drift, undermining trust and fairness.

### Challenges

- **Bias Detection**: AI models often exhibit biases that vary by geography, impacting fairness and inclusivity. For instance, queries like “What happened in Tiananmen Square?” might yield different results in the US compared to China, reflecting local biases and restrictions.

- **Centralized Evaluation**: Current evaluation methods are costly, fragile, and susceptible to vendor capture, limiting transparency and accountability. Proprietary platforms may skew results to favor certain outcomes or vendors, as seen in cases where AI evaluations are influenced by commercial interests.

- **Regional Censorship**: Geopolitical factors influence AI behavior, leading to content filtering and censorship that is difficult to detect and verify. In regions with strict content regulations, AI models may suppress certain topics or keywords, making it challenging to maintain a consistent and fair information landscape globally.

## Opportunity

Decentralized computing, exemplified by the Golem Network, offers a transformative approach to AI evaluation:

- **Independent Validation**: Leverage decentralized nodes to perform unbiased, region-specific evaluations, ensuring diverse and representative insights.
- **Global Coverage**: Utilize Golem’s distributed architecture to achieve comprehensive geographic coverage, enhancing resilience and reliability.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Tap into Golem’s elastic compute resources to scale evaluations efficiently, adapting to varying demand and complexity.
