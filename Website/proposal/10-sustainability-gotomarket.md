## Long-Term Vision

**Community-Driven Development:**
- Future developments beyond initial vision will be led by academic and open-source community needs
- Users (academic and open-source) will identify blockages requiring fixes rather than building new features themselves
- Platform evolution driven by real-world research requirements and user feedback

**Government-Level Impact:**
- Target government leaders to recognize Project Beacon's importance to global AI transparency
- Support final year and PhD students using the platform to demonstrate value to government decision-makers
- Position as critical infrastructure for national AI safety and transparency initiatives

## Go-To-Market Strategy

**Academic-First Approach:**
- Primary targets: University students (final year projects) and PhD researchers
- Secondary targets: AI Safety institutes in London and Cambridge
- Value proposition: Showcase-worthy projects for career advancement and research portfolios

**Partnership Development:**
- Research labs and AI safety institutes as primary partners
- Nonprofits focused on AI transparency and safety
- Government agencies interested in AI oversight and regulation
- Civic tech organizations promoting algorithmic accountability

## Sustainability Model

**Revenue Streams (Post-MVP):**
- Professional services for organizations requiring custom AI bias testing implementations
- Consulting services for governments and institutions establishing AI transparency frameworks
- Grant funding and sponsorship for public research runs
- Optional hosted dashboards with enterprise features and SLA guarantees

**Long-Term Platform Vision:**
- Multi-year research capability allowing users to run continuous monitoring requests
- Integration as one tool within broader AI safety research ecosystem
- Community-maintained benchmarking suite and datasets
- Self-sustaining through combination of grants, professional services, and institutional partnerships

## Expansion Strategy

**Technical Expansion:**
- Reusable components enabling other Golem AI workloads beyond bias detection
- Framework for distributed AI research tasks requiring geographic diversity
- Tools and templates for academic researchers to deploy custom AI evaluation tasks

**Market Expansion:**
- From academic proof-of-concept to government policy tool
- International expansion following successful UK implementation
- Integration with existing AI safety and transparency initiatives
- Platform as foundation for regulatory compliance and oversight tools
