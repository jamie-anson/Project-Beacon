## Executive Summary

Project Beacon addresses the critical challenge of AI transparency and bias detection through a decentralized, verifiable platform built on the Golem Network. As AI systems increasingly influence global decision-making, their opacity and regional variations in behavior pose significant risks to fairness, accountability, and trust.

### The Problem
Current AI systems exhibit concerning patterns of bias, censorship, and policy drift that vary significantly by geographic region and deployment context. Researchers and policymakers lack transparent, reproducible tools to systematically evaluate and compare AI behavior across different contexts, making it impossible to ensure fair and consistent AI deployment globally.

### Our Solution
Project Beacon creates the world's first decentralized AI transparency platform that:
- **Executes standardized benchmarks** across multiple geographic regions using Golem's decentralized compute network
- **Publishes verifiable results** as IPFS bundles with cryptographic Merkle proofs for tamper-evident transparency
- **Provides open datasets and tools** for researchers, policymakers, and the broader community
- **Enables real-time monitoring** through an attester monitoring product that tracks AI behavior changes over time

### Why Golem Network
Golem provides the essential infrastructure for truly decentralized AI evaluation:
- **Geographic diversity**: Providers across different regions enable authentic cross-regional comparisons
- **Decentralized trust**: No single point of control or censorship in the evaluation process
- **Elastic compute**: Cost-effective scaling for large-scale benchmark execution
- **Community alignment**: Shared values of decentralization and open access to computing resources

### Grant Request
**Total Budget**: £3.1 million over 18 months across three production phases:
- **Phase 0** (Months 1-6): Core infrastructure and vertical slice - £1.2M
- **Phase 1** (Months 7-12): Multi-region deployment and comparison tools - £1.0M  
- **Phase 2** (Months 13-18): Public pilot and researcher experience - £0.9M

### Expected Outcomes
- **For Golem**: Flagship application demonstrating real-world utility, driving provider adoption and showcasing decentralized compute capabilities
- **For AI Transparency**: First systematic, verifiable dataset of cross-regional AI behavior differences
- **For Research Community**: Open-source tools, datasets, and methodologies for ongoing AI evaluation
- **For Society**: Increased accountability and transparency in AI systems affecting global populations

### Team & Readiness
Led by Jamie Anson, with extensive experience in distributed systems, AI infrastructure, and open-source development. The project builds on existing Phase 3 infrastructure including operational hybrid routing, multi-region deployment capabilities, and established LLM benchmark frameworks.

Project Beacon represents a strategic opportunity for Golem to establish itself as the premier platform for decentralized AI evaluation while delivering immediate value to the global research community and advancing the cause of AI transparency worldwide.
