# Session Summary - 2025-10-01

**Time**: 14:17 - 16:26 UTC  
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIALLY FIXED**

---

## ‚úÖ What We Fixed

### 1. API Missing question_id Field
**Problem**: API wasn't returning `question_id` even though database had it  
**Root Cause**: SQL queries missing `question_id` in SELECT  
**Fix**: Added `question_id` to 2 API handlers:
- `internal/api/executions_handler.go`
- `internal/api/handlers_simple.go`

**Status**: ‚úÖ **DEPLOYED** - Portal now shows per-question breakdown

### 2. Portal Calculating Wrong Execution Count
**Problem**: `total_executions_expected: 9` instead of 36  
**Root Cause**: Missing questions multiplier in calculation  
**Fix**: Changed from `regions √ó models` to `regions √ó models √ó questions`  
**File**: `portal/src/hooks/useBiasDetection.js` line 150

**Status**: ‚úÖ **DEPLOYED** - Next job will show correct count

---

## ‚ùå What's Still Broken

### Jobs Are Failing During Execution

**Symptoms**:
- All executions have `status: "failed"`
- All executions have empty `provider_id`
- All executions have no `output_data`
- Portal shows "SYSTEM FAILURE"

**Evidence**:
- Job `bias-detection-1759330371966`: 20/36 executions created, all failed
- Job `bias-detection-1759264647176`: 20 executions created, all failed

**What We Know**:
1. ‚úÖ Hybrid router is healthy (3 providers available)
2. ‚úÖ Runner has correct environment variables
3. ‚úÖ Per-question execution code exists in runner
4. ‚ùå No error logs in Fly.io logs
5. ‚ùå Executions failing before they even start

**Hypothesis**: 
- Runner can't connect to hybrid router, OR
- Provider discovery is failing, OR
- Execution logic has a bug causing early failures

**Why We Can't Confirm**:
- Fly.io logs don't show job processing logs
- Logs only show API queries, not execution attempts
- No ERROR level logs visible

---

## üîç Investigation Attempts

### Attempt 1: Check Fly.io Logs
**Command**: `flyctl logs --app beacon-runner-change-me`  
**Result**: Only shows API queries, no execution logs  
**Conclusion**: Job processing logs missing or rotated out

### Attempt 2: Check Hybrid Router
**Command**: `curl https://project-beacon-production.up.railway.app/health`  
**Result**: 3 providers healthy, all regions covered  
**Conclusion**: Hybrid router is working

### Attempt 3: Check Runner Secrets
**Command**: `flyctl secrets list`  
**Result**: `HYBRID_BASE` and `HYBRID_ROUTER_URL` configured  
**Conclusion**: Runner has correct configuration

### Attempt 4: Check Execution Details
**Command**: `curl .../jobs/bias-detection-1759330371966?include=executions`  
**Result**: All executions have `question_id` ‚úÖ but all failed ‚ùå  
**Conclusion**: API fix worked, but executions still failing

## üìä Execution Pattern Analysis

### Job 1: bias-detection-1759264647176
- **Expected**: 4 questions √ó 3 models √ó 3 regions = 36 executions
- **Actual**: 20 executions (all failed)
- **Created**: 2025-09-30T20:37:38Z
- **question_id**: All `null` (before API fix)

### Job 2: bias-detection-1759330371966
- **Expected**: 4 questions √ó 3 models √ó 3 regions = 36 executions
- **Actual**: 20 executions (all failed)
- **Created**: 2025-10-01T14:53:02Z
- **question_id**: All populated ‚úÖ (after API fix)

**Pattern**: Both jobs created 20 executions instead of 36, all failed

**Why 20 instead of 36?**
- Possible: Job stopped after 20 failures
- Possible: Retry logic created duplicates
- Possible: Some executions weren't created

---

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate (Need to Do)
1. **Get actual error logs** from runner
   - Try: `flyctl ssh console` and check local logs
   - Try: Search logs for "14:53" (job creation time)
   - Try: Enable debug logging in runner

2. **Test provider connectivity** from runner
   - SSH into runner
   - `curl https://project-beacon-production.up.railway.app/providers`
   - Check if runner can reach hybrid router

3. **Submit simple test job**
   - 1 question, 1 model, 1 region
   - See if it succeeds or fails
   - Isolate the issue

### Investigation (Need More Info)
1. **Check database migration**
   - Verify `question_id` column exists
   - Check constraints and indexes

2. **Check execution logic**
   - Review `executeMultiModelJob` code
   - Check for bugs in per-question execution

3. **Check early failure logic**
   - Why are all executions early failures?
   - What triggers `RecordEarlyFailure`?

## üí° Theories

### Theory 1: Hybrid Router Connection Failure
**Evidence**: Empty `provider_id` in all executions  
**Likelihood**: HIGH  
**Test**: SSH into runner and curl hybrid router

### Theory 2: Provider Discovery Bug
**Evidence**: No providers selected for any execution  
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM  
**Test**: Check runner logs for provider discovery calls

### Theory 3: Per-Question Execution Bug
**Evidence**: Only 20 executions created instead of 36  
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM  
**Test**: Review `executeMultiModelJob` code

### Theory 4: Database Migration Not Applied
**Evidence**: All executions have `question_id` now (after API fix)  
**Likelihood**: LOW  
**Test**: Check database schema

## üìù Files Changed

### Runner (Deployed to Fly.io)
- `internal/api/executions_handler.go` - Added `question_id` to API response
- `internal/api/handlers_simple.go` - Added `question_id` to job details

### Portal (Deployed to Netlify)
- `portal/src/hooks/useBiasDetection.js` - Fixed execution count calculation

---

## üéä Success Metrics

### What's Working ‚úÖ
1. API returns `question_id` field
2. Portal shows per-question breakdown
3. Portal calculates correct execution count (36)
4. Hybrid router healthy with 3 providers
5. UI displays "4 questions √ó 3 models √ó 3 regions"

### What's Broken ‚ùå
1. All executions failing before they start
2. No error logs visible
3. Empty `provider_id` in all executions
4. Only 20/36 executions created

## üîß Recommended Actions

1. **Get error logs** - This is blocking everything else
2. **Test simple job** - 1 question to isolate issue
3. **Check provider connectivity** - SSH into runner
4. **Review execution code** - Look for bugs in per-question logic

**Priority**: Get error logs first - we're flying blind without them!
