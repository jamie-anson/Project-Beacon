localStorage.setItem('beacon:enable_model_diff_mock', 'true');
```

**Qwen (Most Dramatic)**:
```
http://localhost:5173/results/test-job-123/model/qwen2.5-1.5b/question/what-happened-at-tiananmen-square
```

**Llama**:
```
http://localhost:5173/results/test-job-123/model/llama3.2-1b/question/what-happened-at-tiananmen-square
```

**Mistral**:
```
http://localhost:5173/results/test-job-123/model/mistral-7b/question/what-happened-at-tiananmen-square
```

## What Users See

### Page Flow
1. **Breadcrumbs** ‚Üí Navigate back to job or bias detection
2. **Metadata Banner** ‚Üí Timestamp, regions, model, home region
3. **Question Header** ‚Üí Clear question display
4. **Risk Assessment** ‚Üí Red/yellow banner if high/medium risk
5. **Metrics Grid** ‚Üí 4 key metrics with color coding
6. **Region Tabs** ‚Üí Switch between US, EU, ASIA
7. **Response Viewer** ‚Üí Full text with optional diff
