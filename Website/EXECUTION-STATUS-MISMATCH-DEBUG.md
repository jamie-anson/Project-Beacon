# Execution Status Mismatch Investigation
**Date:** 2025-01-14 23:37  
**Updated:** 2025-10-15 02:42  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY RESOLVED - New issue discovered (Oct 15, 2025)

---

## üö® NEW ISSUE DISCOVERED - Oct 15, 2025 02:48 UTC+01:00

**Problem:** Both EU and US jobs are being executed by the US Modal endpoint instead of their respective regional endpoints.

**Evidence:**
- Modal Dashboard shows `project-beacon-hf-us` executing both US and EU requests
- Both executions show 0ms startup time (warm container)
- Execution times: ~6-10s (US), ~20s (EU)
- All executions marked as "Succeeded" in Modal

**Expected Behavior:**
- US jobs ‚Üí `project-beacon-hf-us` (us-east Modal)
- EU jobs ‚Üí `project-beacon-hf-eu` (eu-west Modal)

**Actual Behavior:**
- US jobs ‚Üí `project-beacon-hf-us` ‚úÖ
- EU jobs ‚Üí `project-beacon-hf-us` ‚ùå (should be eu-west)

**Impact:**
- EU executions not using geographically closer endpoint
- Potential latency issues
- Regional bias detection may be compromised if all executions run from same region

**Investigation Needed:**
1. Check runner's region routing logic (`mapRegionToRouter()`)
2. Verify hybrid router's provider selection
3. Check if EU Modal endpoint is healthy/reachable
4. Review execution logs for region assignment

**Screenshots:**
- Modal Dashboard showing US endpoint handling both regions
- Function calls showing 0ms startup (warm container)
- Execution times: 6.35s, 1m 1s, 59.80s, 1m 48s

**UPDATE 02:49 - CRITICAL FINDING:**

The issue is NOT that EU jobs are going to US Modal. Looking at the timestamps:

- **Portal:** "Job completed successfully!" at 02:47
- **EU Modal:** Executions ran at 02:47:43 and 02:47:45 (AFTER job marked complete)
- **Portal:** Shows 4/4 executions complete

**ACTUAL PROBLEM:** Job is marked as "completed" BEFORE all executions finish!

This is a **goroutine coordination bug** in `executeMultiRegion()`:
- US executions finish first (~6-10s)
- Job marked as "completed" 
- EU executions still running (finish 40-45s later)
- EU executions write to DB after job already "completed"

**Root Cause:**
- `sync.WaitGroup` not waiting for all goroutines
- OR job status updated before `wg.Wait()` completes
- OR context cancelled before EU goroutines finish

**Impact:**
- Portal shows job "completed" while executions still running
- EU executions appear as "late arrivals" in Modal
- Database writes happen after job marked done
- User sees incomplete data until EU finishes

**TODO (Tomorrow - UPDATED):**
- [ ] Review `executeMultiRegion()` goroutine coordination
- [ ] Check if `wg.Wait()` is actually blocking
- [ ] Verify job status update happens AFTER all goroutines complete
- [ ] Check for context cancellation timing
- [ ] Add logging to track goroutine completion order
- [ ] Test with longer-running executions to reproduce

---

## Problem Statement

Portal UI shows executions as "Failed" or "PENDING" even though Modal logs show them as "Succeeded". This creates a data integrity issue where users see incorrect job status.

**Observed Behavior:**
- Modal Dashboard: All executions show "Succeeded" ‚úÖ
- Portal UI: mistral-7b shows "Failed" ‚ùå
- Database: Unknown (need to verify)

**Resolution:** Issue was caused by asynchronous execution timing + polling race condition. See [Root Cause](#root-cause-identified-) section below.

---

## Evidence Collected

### 1. Portal UI Behavior

**Screenshot Evidence:**
- mistral-7b (United States): Status = "Failed" (red badge)
- llama3.2-1b: Completed successfully
- qwen2.5-1.5b: Still pending

**Console Warnings:**
```javascript
[MISSING EXECUTION] Q:identity_basic M:mistral-7b R:EU
[MISSING EXECUTION] Q:identity_basic M:qwen2.5-1.5b R:EU
[MISSING EXECUTION] Q:taiwan_status M:llama3.2-1b R:EU
// ... multiple missing EU executions
```

**Debug Output:**
```javascript
{
  lookingFor: "EU",
  lookingForType: "string",
  availableExecs: (1) [...]  // Only 1 execution found (likely US)
}
```

### 2. Modal Infrastructure Status

**Modal Dashboard (Run #20):**
- Enqueued: Oct 14, 2025 at 23:34:38
- Started: Oct 14, 2025 at 23:34:38
- Startup: 0ms (warm container)
- Execution: 45.11s
- Status: ‚úÖ **Succeeded**

**Modal Dashboard (Run #19):**
- Execution: 1m 33s
- Status: ‚úÖ **Succeeded**

**Modal Dashboard (Run #18):**
- Status: üü£ **Running** (still in progress)

**Modal Logs Warning (Non-Critical):**
```
The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input 
because pad token is same as eos token.
```
- This is a Hugging Face Transformers warning
- Does NOT cause execution failure
- Can be fixed with proper attention_mask handling

### 3. Architecture Flow

```
User submits job
    ‚Üì
Runner spawns 3 region goroutines (US, EU, APAC)
    ‚Üì
Each region ‚Üí Hybrid Router ‚Üí Modal endpoint
    ‚Üì
Modal executes inference ‚Üí Returns response
    ‚Üì
Runner receives response ‚Üí Writes to database
    ‚Üì
Portal polls database ‚Üí Shows status to user
```

**Bottleneck Identified:** Runner ‚Üí Database write step

---

## Root Cause Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: Runner Misinterpreting Modal Response ‚≠ê LIKELY

**Theory:** Runner receives successful Modal response but marks it as failed due to:
- Response validation failure
- ~~Timeout (even though Modal succeeded)~~ **RULED OUT** ‚ùå
- Missing/malformed fields in response
- Exception during response parsing

**Evidence:**
- Modal shows success
- Portal shows failure
- ~~Timing suggests runner timeout (45s execution might exceed runner's timeout)~~

**Timeout Configuration Found:**
```go
// internal/hybrid/client.go line 29
timeoutSec := 300  // 5 minutes = 300 seconds
httpClient: &http.Client{Timeout: time.Duration(timeoutSec) * time.Second}
```
- **Runner timeout: 300s (5 minutes)** ‚úÖ
- **Modal execution: 45s** ‚úÖ
- **Timeout is NOT the issue** - plenty of headroom

**ROOT CAUSE FOUND:** ‚úÖ

**Location:** `hybrid_router/core/router.py` line 414
```python
# Treat empty text as failure for better upstream handling
if bool(success) and (resp_text is None or str(resp_text).strip() == ""):
    return {
        "success": False,
        "error": "Provider returned empty response",
        "error_code": "EMPTY_MODEL_RESPONSE",
    }
```

**The Bug:**
1. Modal executes successfully (45s, status="success")
2. Modal returns empty or whitespace-only response text
3. Router marks it as `success=False` due to empty response
4. Runner receives `success=False` and marks execution as "failed"
5. Database stores status="failed"
6. Portal shows "Failed" even though Modal succeeded

**Why Empty Response:**
- Model might return empty string for certain prompts
- Tokenization issues (attention mask warning)
- Model refusing to answer
- Response parsing error in Modal

**How to Verify:**
- Check Modal logs for actual response content
- Check router logs for "EMPTY_MODEL_RESPONSE" error
- Check runner logs for "hybrid error: Provider returned empty response"

**Potential Fixes:**
1. **Fix Modal:** Ensure models always return non-empty responses
2. **Fix Router:** Don't treat empty responses as failures (return success with empty string)
3. **Fix Runner:** Handle empty responses gracefully (mark as "completed" with empty output)

---

### Hypothesis 2: Database Write Failure

**Theory:** Runner tries to write "completed" status but database write fails, defaults to "failed"

**Evidence:**
- Execution record exists (portal shows it)
- Status is wrong

**How to Verify:**
- Check runner logs for database errors
- Query database directly for execution status
- Check for transaction rollbacks

**Potential Fix:**
- Add database write retries
- Better error handling for partial failures
- Transaction isolation improvements

---

### Hypothesis 3: Race Condition in Status Updates

**Theory:** Multiple goroutines updating same execution, last write wins with wrong status

**Evidence:**
- Parallel execution across regions
- Timing-sensitive behavior

**How to Verify:**
- Check for duplicate execution IDs
- Review goroutine synchronization
- Check database transaction logs

**Potential Fix:**
- Add optimistic locking
- Use database-level status transitions
- Serialize status updates per execution

---

### Hypothesis 4: Portal Misreading Database Status

**Theory:** Database has correct status, portal transforms it incorrectly

**Evidence:**
- Less likely given console shows missing executions
- Would affect all executions, not just some

**How to Verify:**
- Query database directly
- Compare with portal API response
- Check status normalization logic

**Potential Fix:**
- Fix status mapping in portal
- Standardize status values

---

## Related Issues Discovered

### Issue 1: Portal Region Name Mismatch ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:** Portal couldn't match EU executions due to region name format
- Database: `'eu-west'`
- Portal: `'EU'`
- `normalizeRegion()` wasn't handling all variants

**Fix Applied:** Updated `normalizeRegion()` with explicit checks
**Status:** Deployed to production (commit b689c33)
**Verification:** Waiting for Netlify deployment + job completion

---

### Issue 2: Missing EU Executions

**Problem:** Portal shows only US executions, EU executions missing
**Possible Causes:**
1. EU executions haven't completed yet (still running)
2. EU executions failed to write to database
3. API query filtering out EU executions

**Current Status:** 
- 3 completed (likely all US)
- 9 pending (likely EU + remaining US)
- Job still in progress

---

## Investigation Plan

### Step 1: Check Runner Logs (IMMEDIATE)

**What to look for:**
```bash
# Search for mistral-7b execution logs
grep -i "mistral-7b" runner.log

# Look for timeout errors
grep -i "timeout\|timed out" runner.log

# Look for database errors
grep -i "failed to insert\|database error" runner.log

# Look for status transitions
grep -i "status.*failed\|marking.*failed" runner.log
```

**Expected findings:**
- Timeout error for mistral-7b (45s execution)
- Database insert success/failure
- Actual status being written

---

### Step 2: Query Database Directly

**SQL Queries:**
```sql
-- Check all executions for this job
SELECT 
    id, 
    region, 
    model_id, 
    question_id, 
    status, 
    started_at, 
    completed_at,
    created_at
FROM executions e
JOIN jobs j ON e.job_id = j.id
WHERE j.jobspec_id = '<job-id>'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check for failed executions
SELECT * FROM executions 
WHERE status = 'failed' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- Check execution counts by status
SELECT status, COUNT(*) 
FROM executions e
JOIN jobs j ON e.job_id = j.id
WHERE j.jobspec_id = '<job-id>'
GROUP BY status;
```

**Expected findings:**
- Actual status values in database
- Whether EU executions exist
- Timing of status updates

---

### Step 3: Check Runner Timeout Configuration

**Files to check:**
```go
// runner-app/internal/worker/job_runner.go
// Look for timeout configuration

// runner-app/internal/executor/*.go
// Check HTTP client timeouts

// hybrid_router/core/router.py
// Check Modal request timeout
```

**Current known timeouts:**
- Hybrid Router: 600s (10 minutes)
- Modal: 900s (15 minutes)
- Runner: ??? (need to check)

**If runner timeout < 45s:** That's the problem!

---

### Step 4: Review Response Validation

**Check:**
```go
// runner-app/internal/worker/job_runner.go
// Lines around execution result handling
// Look for validation that might reject valid responses
```

**Possible issues:**
- Strict schema validation
- Required fields that Modal doesn't return
- Type mismatches

---

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Fix Router Empty Response Handling ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

**Implementation:**
```python
# hybrid_router/core/router.py line 414
# REMOVE this check that treats empty responses as failures:
# if bool(success) and (resp_text is None or str(resp_text).strip() == ""):
#     return {"success": False, "error": "Provider returned empty response"}

# REPLACE with:
if bool(success):
    # Allow empty responses - some models may return empty for certain prompts
    # Upstream can handle empty responses appropriately
    resp_text = resp_text or ""  # Convert None to empty string
```

**Pros:**
- Fixes root cause directly
- Simple one-line change
- Allows models to return empty responses legitimately
- No false failures

**Cons:**
- Empty responses now marked as "success"
- Need to handle empty responses in portal UI
- May hide actual model failures

**Effort:** 5 minutes
**Risk:** Low

**Alternative:** Add a flag to distinguish "empty but successful" from "failed"

---

### Solution 2: Improve Error Handling

**Implementation:**
```go
// Distinguish between different failure types
if err != nil {
    if isTimeout(err) {
        // Mark as "timeout" not "failed"
        status = "timeout"
    } else if isValidationError(err) {
        // Log validation error but mark as "completed" if Modal succeeded
        status = "completed"
    } else {
        status = "failed"
    }
}
```

**Pros:**
- More granular status tracking
- Better debugging
- Prevents false failures

**Cons:**
- More complex logic
- Need to define all error types

**Effort:** 30 minutes
**Risk:** Medium

---

### Solution 3: Add Status Reconciliation

**Implementation:**
```go
// Periodic job that checks Modal status and updates database
func reconcileExecutionStatuses() {
    // For each "failed" execution
    // Check Modal logs
    // If Modal shows success, update to "completed"
}
```

**Pros:**
- Fixes existing bad data
- Prevents future mismatches
- Self-healing system

**Cons:**
- Additional complexity
- Requires Modal API integration
- Periodic overhead

**Effort:** 2 hours
**Risk:** Medium

---

### Solution 4: Retry Failed Executions

**Implementation:**
```go
// If execution fails, check if it's retriable
if status == "failed" && isRetriable(err) {
    // Add to retry queue
    retryExecution(jobID, modelID, region, questionID)
}
```

**Pros:**
- Handles transient failures
- Improves success rate
- User doesn't see failures

**Cons:**
- Increased cost (duplicate executions)
- Complexity
- May hide real issues

**Effort:** 1 hour
**Risk:** Medium

## Latest Findings (2025-01-14 23:50)

### Multiple Failure Types Observed

**Console shows 3 distinct error patterns:**

1. **[MISSING EXECUTION]** - Portal can't find EU executions
   - Root cause: Region name mismatch ('eu-west' vs 'EU')
   - Status: ‚úÖ FIXED (normalizeRegion() updated, deployed)
   - Waiting for: Netlify deployment + new job to verify

2. **[FAILED EXECUTIONS]** - Database has failed status
   - Root cause: Router marks empty responses as failed
   - Status: ‚úÖ FIXED (router.py line 414 removed, deployed)
   - Waiting for: Railway deployment (~2 min)

3. **[MODEL EXECS WITH FAILURES]** - Specific model failures
   - Pattern: mistral-7b failing across multiple questions
   - Questions: greatest_leader, taiwan_status, tiananmen_neutral
   - Root cause: Same as #2 - empty response ‚Üí false failure

### Key Insight

**Modal and LLMs are working correctly.** The issue is in our data transformation pipeline:

```
Modal (‚úÖ Executes successfully, may return empty response)
    ‚Üì
Hybrid Router (‚ùå OLD: Rejects empty ‚Üí marks as failed)
                (‚úÖ NEW: Accepts empty ‚Üí marks as success)
    ‚Üì
Runner (Stores whatever router returns)
    ‚Üì
Portal (Shows whatever database has)
```

### Why mistral-7b Fails More

Mistral-7b appears to return empty responses more frequently than other models:
- Possibly more sensitive to prompt formatting
- May refuse certain questions (content filtering)
- Attention mask warning suggests tokenization issues
- But **execution completes successfully** - just returns ""

### Verification Plan

After Railway deploys router fix (~2 min):

1. **Submit new test job** with same questions
2. **Check Modal logs** - Should show success
3. **Check router response** - Should have success=true even if response=""
4. **Check database** - Should store status="completed"
5. **Check portal** - Should show "Completed" not "Failed"

### US vs EU Flow Investigation ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Investigation Date:** 2025-01-15 00:06  
**Full Report:** [US-EU-FLOW-COMPARISON.md](./US-EU-FLOW-COMPARISON.md)

#### Key Finding: No US/EU-Specific Differences

Comprehensive investigation of the entire execution flow revealed:

‚úÖ **US and EU are configured identically:**
- Same provider setup in router
- Same cost_per_second (0.00005)
- Same max_concurrent (10)
- Same code paths for execution

‚úÖ **Symmetric region mapping:**
- US ‚Üí us-east
- EU ‚Üí eu-west
- Same mapping logic in both directions

‚úÖ **No region-specific bugs found:**
- Both use identical Modal inference code
- Both process responses the same way
- Both write to database using same logic
- Both display in portal using same UI

#### Why EU Appeared Broken

**Not EU-specific issues!** Both regions affected equally by:

1. **Router empty response bug** - Affected both US and EU
2. **Portal normalization bug** - Affected both US and EU

**Why we saw more EU failures:**
- **Timing:** US executions completed faster (geographic proximity)
- **Observation bias:** Checked portal while EU still pending
- **Cold starts:** EU Modal endpoints may have longer cold starts
- **Network latency:** eu-west has higher latency from test location

#### Investigation Results

**Checked:**
1. ‚úÖ Provider configuration - Identical
2. ‚úÖ Region mapping logic - Symmetric
3. ‚úÖ Modal endpoints - Different URLs, same behavior
4. ‚úÖ Response processing - Same code path
5. ‚úÖ Database writes - Same SQL
6. ‚úÖ Portal rendering - Same logic

**Conclusion REVISED:**
- ‚ùå **INCORRECT ANALYSIS** - EU is specifically affected
- Console shows ONLY `R:EU` missing executions
- NO `R:US` missing execution warnings  
- US executions ARE being found ‚úÖ
- EU executions are NOT being found ‚ùå
- This IS an EU-specific problem

**CONFIRMED ROOT CAUSE:** ‚úÖ

**Database Analysis Results (Job: bias-detection-1760458397970):**

**Executions Found:**
- US: 9 executions (3 models √ó 3 questions)
- EU: 5 executions (MISSING 4!)

**Missing EU Executions:**
1. ‚ùå qwen2.5-1.5b + identity_basic + EU
2. ‚ùå qwen2.5-1.5b + greatest_leader + EU  
3. ‚ùå qwen2.5-1.5b + tiananmen_neutral + EU
4. ‚ùå mistral-7b + tiananmen_neutral + EU

**Region Name Discovery:**
- Database stores: `"EU"` and `"US"` (uppercase)
- NOT `"eu-west"` and `"us-east"` as expected
- This means runner is storing uppercase, not the mapped lowercase

**The Real Problem:**
- Some EU executions ARE being written ‚úÖ (5 found in cancelled job)
- But NOT ALL EU executions are being written ‚ùå (4 missing in cancelled job)
- Specifically: ALL qwen2.5-1.5b EU executions missing in cancelled job
- **BUT:** Completed job shows ALL EU executions present (including qwen2.5-1.5b)

**Completed Job Analysis (bias-detection-1760476855858):**
- Status: "completed" ‚úÖ
- US: 6 executions (3 models √ó 2 questions) ‚úÖ
- EU: 6 executions (3 models √ó 2 questions) ‚úÖ
- All completed successfully ‚úÖ
- qwen2.5-1.5b EU executions present ‚úÖ

**Cancelled Job Analysis (bias-detection-1760458397970):**
- Status: "cancelled" ‚ùå
- US: 9 executions (complete)
- EU: 5 executions (missing 4)
- Missing: qwen2.5-1.5b EU (all 3 questions) + mistral-7b tiananmen_neutral EU

**Conclusion:**
- System CAN write EU executions successfully ‚úÖ
- Missing executions in cancelled job = job was cancelled mid-flight
- US finished faster, EU still running when cancel hit

**UNRESOLVED ISSUE:**
- Why does portal show `[MISSING EXECUTION] R:EU` for CURRENT/RUNNING jobs?
- Is it because executions haven't completed yet?
- Or is there a real-time display bug?
- Need to test with a NEW job to verify fixes work

**Immediate Investigation Needed:**

Check runner logs for:
```bash
# Look for EU execution completion
grep -i "eu-west\|EU" runner.log | grep -i "execution\|completed\|failed"

# Look for database write errors
grep -i "failed to insert" runner.log

# Look for EU-specific errors
grep -i "eu" runner.log | grep -i "error\|failed"

# Check if EU goroutines are being cancelled
grep -i "execution cancelled" runner.log
```

**Possible root causes:**

1. **Job-level timeout** - Parent context cancelled before EU completes
   - US finishes in 45s ‚úÖ
   - EU still running when job times out ‚ùå
   
2. **Database connection issue** - EU writes failing silently
   - Check for `"failed to insert execution record"` in logs
   
3. **Goroutine coordination bug** - EU goroutines not awaited properly
   - Check if `regionWg.Wait()` is being called
   
4. **Empty response causing skip** - EU returning empty, runner skipping insert
   - But Modal shows success, so this shouldn't happen
   
5. **Context propagation issue** - EU goroutines using cancelled context
   - Check for `ctx.Err() != nil` before EU writes

#### Comparative Flow

```
              US                           EU
Portal:      "US"                        "EU"

Database:    region="us-east"            region="eu-west"
             status="completed"           status="completed"
    ‚Üì                                      ‚Üì
Portal:      normalizeRegion ‚Üí "US"      normalizeRegion ‚Üí "EU"
             Shows "Completed" ‚úÖ         Shows "Completed" ‚úÖ
```

**Status:** üîç Investigation complete - No region-specific issues found

### Expected Outcome

**Before fix:**
- Modal: ‚úÖ Success (45s execution)
- Response: "" (empty)
- Router: ‚ùå success=false, error="Empty response"
- Database: status="failed"
- Portal: "Failed" ‚ùå

**After fix:**
- Modal: ‚úÖ Success (45s execution)
- Response: "" (empty)
- Router: ‚úÖ success=true, response=""
- Database: status="completed"
- Portal: "Completed" ‚úÖ

Users will see the execution completed but may have empty results, which is more accurate than showing it failed.

---

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED ‚úÖ

### **The Real Problem: Asynchronous Execution + Polling Race Condition**

**What's Happening:**

1. **Runner executes regions in parallel** (US, EU goroutines)
2. **Each execution writes to DB immediately after completion**
3. **US executions finish first** (~45s, closer geographically)
4. **Portal polls every 15 seconds**
5. **Portal receives incomplete execution data** during job execution
6. **Transform shows `[MISSING EXECUTION]`** for executions that don't exist yet
7. **EU executions complete later** (slower due to cold starts/latency)
8. **Next poll shows all executions** ‚úÖ

**Timeline Example (Job: bias-detection-1760486456215):**
```
00:03:06 - US mistral-7b completes ‚Üí DB write
00:03:XX - Portal polls ‚Üí Gets 1 execution ‚Üí Shows "MISSING" for EU ‚ùå
00:04:51 - US qwen2.5-1.5b completes ‚Üí DB write
00:05:XX - Portal polls ‚Üí Gets 2 executions ‚Üí Still shows "MISSING" for EU ‚ùå
00:06:14 - EU mistral-7b completes ‚Üí DB write
00:07:XX - Portal polls ‚Üí Gets 3 executions ‚Üí Still shows "MISSING" for EU qwen ‚ùå
00:08:17 - EU qwen2.5-1.5b completes ‚Üí DB write
00:08:XX - Portal polls ‚Üí Gets 4 executions ‚Üí No more warnings ‚úÖ
```

**Console Evidence:**
```javascript
totalExecutions: 1  // ‚ùå Should be 4, but only 1 written to DB so far
selectedRegions: Array(2)  // US, EU
models: Array(2)  // mistral-7b, qwen2.5-1.5b
```

**Why EU Shows Missing But Not US:**
- US executions complete FIRST (faster)
- By the time portal polls, US already in DB
- EU still executing when portal checks
- Portal sees: ‚úÖ US exists, ‚ùå EU doesn't exist yet
- This is **correct** - EU genuinely doesn't exist in DB yet!

### ‚úÖ Confirmed Working:
1. **EU executions ARE being written** - All 4 found in completed job
2. **Region matching logic works** - `normalizeRegion("EU") === "EU"` ‚úÖ
3. **Database writes work** - No silent failures
4. **Router empty response fix** - Deployed
5. **Portal region normalization** - Fixed and deployed

### ‚ùå Actual Issues:

1. **Portal shows alarming warnings for normal async behavior**
   - `[MISSING EXECUTION]` is technically correct but misleading
   - Should say `[EXECUTION PENDING]` during job execution
   - Only show `[MISSING EXECUTION]` after job completes

2. **Portal doesn't update fast enough**
   - Polls every 15 seconds
   - Executions complete every 1-2 minutes
   - User sees stale data for 15+ seconds
   - Need faster polling or WebSocket updates

3. **No visual feedback that executions are in progress**
   - User doesn't know EU is still running
   - Looks like a failure when it's just pending
   - Need "Running..." status in UI

## Solutions

### **Fix 1: Improve Console Logging** (Quick Win)

Change warning to be context-aware:

```javascript
// portal/src/components/bias-detection/liveProgressHelpers.js
if (!regionExec && modelExecs.length > 0) {
  const jobStatus = activeJob?.status;
  const isJobRunning = jobStatus === 'processing' || jobStatus === 'queued' || jobStatus === 'running';
  
  if (isJobRunning) {
    // Job still running - execution is pending, not missing
    console.log(`[EXECUTION PENDING] Q:${questionId} M:${modelId} R:${region} - Job still executing`);
  } else {
    // Job completed - execution is genuinely missing
    console.warn(`[MISSING EXECUTION] Q:${questionId} M:${modelId} R:${region}`, {
      lookingFor: region,
      availableExecs: modelExecs.map(e => ({ 
        id: e.id, 
        region: e.region,
        status: e.status
      }))
    });
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Less alarming during normal execution
- ‚úÖ More informative (user knows it's pending)
- ‚úÖ Still warns if genuinely missing after completion

### **Fix 2: Faster Polling During Execution** (Medium Effort)

Adjust polling interval based on job status:

```javascript
// portal/src/pages/BiasDetection.jsx
const pollMs = useMemo(() => {
  if (!activeJob) return 15000; // Default: 15s
  
  const status = activeJob.status;
  if (status === 'processing' || status === 'running') {
    return 5000; // Active job: 5s (faster updates)
  }
  if (status === 'completed' || status === 'failed') {
    return 0; // Terminal state: stop polling
  }
  return 15000; // Default
}, [activeJob?.status]);
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ User sees updates every 5s during execution
- ‚úÖ Reduces perceived lag
- ‚úÖ Stops polling when job completes (saves API calls)

### **Fix 3: WebSocket Real-Time Updates** (Long-Term)

Replace polling with WebSocket for instant updates:

```javascript
// Runner sends WebSocket message when execution completes
ws.send({
  type: 'execution_completed',
  job_id: 'bias-detection-123',
  execution: { id: 123, region: 'EU', model_id: 'qwen2.5-1.5b', status: 'completed' }
});

// Portal receives and updates immediately
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const { type, execution } = JSON.parse(event.data);
  if (type === 'execution_completed') {
    // Update local state immediately
    setActiveJob(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      executions: [...prev.executions, execution]
    }));
  }
};
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Instant updates (no 5-15s delay)
- ‚úÖ No polling overhead
- ‚úÖ Better UX

### **Fix 4: Show "Running" Status in UI** (Quick Win)

Update UI to show pending executions:

```javascript
// Show "Running..." for missing executions during job execution
const getExecutionDisplay = (execution, jobStatus) => {
  if (!execution && (jobStatus === 'processing' || jobStatus === 'running')) {
    return { status: 'running', text: 'Running...', color: 'blue' };
  }
  if (!execution) {
    return { status: 'missing', text: 'Missing', color: 'red' };
  }
  return { status: execution.status, text: execution.status, color: 'green' };
};
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ User sees "Running..." instead of blank/error
- ‚úÖ Clear visual feedback
- ‚úÖ Reduces confusion

## Next Steps

### **Immediate (Today):**
1. ‚úÖ **Fix 1: Improve console logging** - DEPLOYED (Commit c89da0f)
   - Changed `[MISSING EXECUTION]` to `[EXECUTION PENDING]` during job execution
   - Only shows `[MISSING EXECUTION]` after job completes
   - Less alarming, more informative
   
2. ‚úÖ **Fix 2: Faster polling** - ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
   - Portal already polls every 2-5s during execution
   - Adaptive polling based on job age:
     - First 30s: 2s interval
     - First 5 min: 3s interval
     - After 5 min: 5s interval
   - Stops polling when job completes
   
3. üîÑ **Fix 4: Show "Running" in UI** - TODO
   - Visual feedback for pending executions
   - Show "Running..." instead of blank

### **Short-Term (This Week):**
4. üß™ **Test with new job** - Verify Fix 1 works
5. üìä **Monitor execution times** - Track US vs EU completion times

### **Long-Term (Next Sprint):**
6. üîå **Fix 3: WebSocket updates** - Real-time execution updates
7. üìà **Performance monitoring** - Dashboard for execution metrics

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED - Console logging improved, polling already optimized, ready to test
