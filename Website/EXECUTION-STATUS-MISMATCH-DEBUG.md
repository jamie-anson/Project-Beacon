# Execution Status Mismatch Investigation
**Date:** 2025-01-14 23:37  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Status:** üîç INVESTIGATING

---

## Problem Statement

Portal UI shows executions as "Failed" even though Modal logs show them as "Succeeded". This creates a data integrity issue where users see incorrect job status.

**Observed Behavior:**
- Modal Dashboard: All executions show "Succeeded" ‚úÖ
- Portal UI: mistral-7b shows "Failed" ‚ùå
- Database: Unknown (need to verify)

---

## Evidence Collected

### 1. Portal UI Behavior

**Screenshot Evidence:**
- mistral-7b (United States): Status = "Failed" (red badge)
- llama3.2-1b: Completed successfully
- qwen2.5-1.5b: Still pending

**Console Warnings:**
```javascript
[MISSING EXECUTION] Q:identity_basic M:mistral-7b R:EU
[MISSING EXECUTION] Q:identity_basic M:qwen2.5-1.5b R:EU
[MISSING EXECUTION] Q:taiwan_status M:llama3.2-1b R:EU
// ... multiple missing EU executions
```

**Debug Output:**
```javascript
{
  lookingFor: "EU",
  lookingForType: "string",
  availableExecs: (1) [...]  // Only 1 execution found (likely US)
}
```

### 2. Modal Infrastructure Status

**Modal Dashboard (Run #20):**
- Enqueued: Oct 14, 2025 at 23:34:38
- Started: Oct 14, 2025 at 23:34:38
- Startup: 0ms (warm container)
- Execution: 45.11s
- Status: ‚úÖ **Succeeded**

**Modal Dashboard (Run #19):**
- Execution: 1m 33s
- Status: ‚úÖ **Succeeded**

**Modal Dashboard (Run #18):**
- Status: üü£ **Running** (still in progress)

**Modal Logs Warning (Non-Critical):**
```
The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input 
because pad token is same as eos token.
```
- This is a Hugging Face Transformers warning
- Does NOT cause execution failure
- Can be fixed with proper attention_mask handling

### 3. Architecture Flow

```
User submits job
    ‚Üì
Runner spawns 3 region goroutines (US, EU, APAC)
    ‚Üì
Each region ‚Üí Hybrid Router ‚Üí Modal endpoint
    ‚Üì
Modal executes inference ‚Üí Returns response
    ‚Üì
Runner receives response ‚Üí Writes to database
    ‚Üì
Portal polls database ‚Üí Shows status to user
```

**Bottleneck Identified:** Runner ‚Üí Database write step

---

## Root Cause Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: Runner Misinterpreting Modal Response ‚≠ê LIKELY

**Theory:** Runner receives successful Modal response but marks it as failed due to:
- Response validation failure
- ~~Timeout (even though Modal succeeded)~~ **RULED OUT** ‚ùå
- Missing/malformed fields in response
- Exception during response parsing

**Evidence:**
- Modal shows success
- Portal shows failure
- ~~Timing suggests runner timeout (45s execution might exceed runner's timeout)~~

**Timeout Configuration Found:**
```go
// internal/hybrid/client.go line 29
timeoutSec := 300  // 5 minutes = 300 seconds
httpClient: &http.Client{Timeout: time.Duration(timeoutSec) * time.Second}
```
- **Runner timeout: 300s (5 minutes)** ‚úÖ
- **Modal execution: 45s** ‚úÖ
- **Timeout is NOT the issue** - plenty of headroom

**ROOT CAUSE FOUND:** ‚úÖ

**Location:** `hybrid_router/core/router.py` line 414
```python
# Treat empty text as failure for better upstream handling
if bool(success) and (resp_text is None or str(resp_text).strip() == ""):
    return {
        "success": False,
        "error": "Provider returned empty response",
        "error_code": "EMPTY_MODEL_RESPONSE",
    }
```

**The Bug:**
1. Modal executes successfully (45s, status="success")
2. Modal returns empty or whitespace-only response text
3. Router marks it as `success=False` due to empty response
4. Runner receives `success=False` and marks execution as "failed"
5. Database stores status="failed"
6. Portal shows "Failed" even though Modal succeeded

**Why Empty Response:**
- Model might return empty string for certain prompts
- Tokenization issues (attention mask warning)
- Model refusing to answer
- Response parsing error in Modal

**How to Verify:**
- Check Modal logs for actual response content
- Check router logs for "EMPTY_MODEL_RESPONSE" error
- Check runner logs for "hybrid error: Provider returned empty response"

**Potential Fixes:**
1. **Fix Modal:** Ensure models always return non-empty responses
2. **Fix Router:** Don't treat empty responses as failures (return success with empty string)
3. **Fix Runner:** Handle empty responses gracefully (mark as "completed" with empty output)

---

### Hypothesis 2: Database Write Failure

**Theory:** Runner tries to write "completed" status but database write fails, defaults to "failed"

**Evidence:**
- Execution record exists (portal shows it)
- Status is wrong

**How to Verify:**
- Check runner logs for database errors
- Query database directly for execution status
- Check for transaction rollbacks

**Potential Fix:**
- Add database write retries
- Better error handling for partial failures
- Transaction isolation improvements

---

### Hypothesis 3: Race Condition in Status Updates

**Theory:** Multiple goroutines updating same execution, last write wins with wrong status

**Evidence:**
- Parallel execution across regions
- Timing-sensitive behavior

**How to Verify:**
- Check for duplicate execution IDs
- Review goroutine synchronization
- Check database transaction logs

**Potential Fix:**
- Add optimistic locking
- Use database-level status transitions
- Serialize status updates per execution

---

### Hypothesis 4: Portal Misreading Database Status

**Theory:** Database has correct status, portal transforms it incorrectly

**Evidence:**
- Less likely given console shows missing executions
- Would affect all executions, not just some

**How to Verify:**
- Query database directly
- Compare with portal API response
- Check status normalization logic

**Potential Fix:**
- Fix status mapping in portal
- Standardize status values

---

## Related Issues Discovered

### Issue 1: Portal Region Name Mismatch ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:** Portal couldn't match EU executions due to region name format
- Database: `'eu-west'`
- Portal: `'EU'`
- `normalizeRegion()` wasn't handling all variants

**Fix Applied:** Updated `normalizeRegion()` with explicit checks
**Status:** Deployed to production (commit b689c33)
**Verification:** Waiting for Netlify deployment + job completion

---

### Issue 2: Missing EU Executions

**Problem:** Portal shows only US executions, EU executions missing
**Possible Causes:**
1. EU executions haven't completed yet (still running)
2. EU executions failed to write to database
3. API query filtering out EU executions

**Current Status:** 
- 3 completed (likely all US)
- 9 pending (likely EU + remaining US)
- Job still in progress

---

## Investigation Plan

### Step 1: Check Runner Logs (IMMEDIATE)

**What to look for:**
```bash
# Search for mistral-7b execution logs
grep -i "mistral-7b" runner.log

# Look for timeout errors
grep -i "timeout\|timed out" runner.log

# Look for database errors
grep -i "failed to insert\|database error" runner.log

# Look for status transitions
grep -i "status.*failed\|marking.*failed" runner.log
```

**Expected findings:**
- Timeout error for mistral-7b (45s execution)
- Database insert success/failure
- Actual status being written

---

### Step 2: Query Database Directly

**SQL Queries:**
```sql
-- Check all executions for this job
SELECT 
    id, 
    region, 
    model_id, 
    question_id, 
    status, 
    started_at, 
    completed_at,
    created_at
FROM executions e
JOIN jobs j ON e.job_id = j.id
WHERE j.jobspec_id = '<job-id>'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check for failed executions
SELECT * FROM executions 
WHERE status = 'failed' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- Check execution counts by status
SELECT status, COUNT(*) 
FROM executions e
JOIN jobs j ON e.job_id = j.id
WHERE j.jobspec_id = '<job-id>'
GROUP BY status;
```

**Expected findings:**
- Actual status values in database
- Whether EU executions exist
- Timing of status updates

---

### Step 3: Check Runner Timeout Configuration

**Files to check:**
```go
// runner-app/internal/worker/job_runner.go
// Look for timeout configuration

// runner-app/internal/executor/*.go
// Check HTTP client timeouts

// hybrid_router/core/router.py
// Check Modal request timeout
```

**Current known timeouts:**
- Hybrid Router: 600s (10 minutes)
- Modal: 900s (15 minutes)
- Runner: ??? (need to check)

**If runner timeout < 45s:** That's the problem!

---

### Step 4: Review Response Validation

**Check:**
```go
// runner-app/internal/worker/job_runner.go
// Lines around execution result handling
// Look for validation that might reject valid responses
```

**Possible issues:**
- Strict schema validation
- Required fields that Modal doesn't return
- Type mismatches

---

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Fix Router Empty Response Handling ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

**Implementation:**
```python
# hybrid_router/core/router.py line 414
# REMOVE this check that treats empty responses as failures:
# if bool(success) and (resp_text is None or str(resp_text).strip() == ""):
#     return {"success": False, "error": "Provider returned empty response"}

# REPLACE with:
if bool(success):
    # Allow empty responses - some models may return empty for certain prompts
    # Upstream can handle empty responses appropriately
    resp_text = resp_text or ""  # Convert None to empty string
```

**Pros:**
- Fixes root cause directly
- Simple one-line change
- Allows models to return empty responses legitimately
- No false failures

**Cons:**
- Empty responses now marked as "success"
- Need to handle empty responses in portal UI
- May hide actual model failures

**Effort:** 5 minutes
**Risk:** Low

**Alternative:** Add a flag to distinguish "empty but successful" from "failed"

---

### Solution 2: Improve Error Handling

**Implementation:**
```go
// Distinguish between different failure types
if err != nil {
    if isTimeout(err) {
        // Mark as "timeout" not "failed"
        status = "timeout"
    } else if isValidationError(err) {
        // Log validation error but mark as "completed" if Modal succeeded
        status = "completed"
    } else {
        status = "failed"
    }
}
```

**Pros:**
- More granular status tracking
- Better debugging
- Prevents false failures

**Cons:**
- More complex logic
- Need to define all error types

**Effort:** 30 minutes
**Risk:** Medium

---

### Solution 3: Add Status Reconciliation

**Implementation:**
```go
// Periodic job that checks Modal status and updates database
func reconcileExecutionStatuses() {
    // For each "failed" execution
    // Check Modal logs
    // If Modal shows success, update to "completed"
}
```

**Pros:**
- Fixes existing bad data
- Prevents future mismatches
- Self-healing system

**Cons:**
- Additional complexity
- Requires Modal API integration
- Periodic overhead

**Effort:** 2 hours
**Risk:** Medium

---

### Solution 4: Retry Failed Executions

**Implementation:**
```go
// If execution fails, check if it's retriable
if status == "failed" && isRetriable(err) {
    // Add to retry queue
    retryExecution(jobID, modelID, region, questionID)
}
```

**Pros:**
- Handles transient failures
- Improves success rate
- User doesn't see failures

**Cons:**
- Increased cost (duplicate executions)
- Complexity
- May hide real issues

**Effort:** 1 hour
**Risk:** Medium
