# Golem Provider Status - Phase 1: Testnet Provider Setup

Based on `/Users/Jammie/Desktop/Project Beacon/Website/golem-node-plan.md`

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites (Complete)
- [x] Hardware selection (Docker x86_64 emulation on Apple Silicon)
- [x] Basic understanding of Golem provider requirements
- [x] Testnet GLM tokens for staking/operations (1000 tGLM + 0.0099 tETH)
- [x] Monitoring infrastructure ready

## ‚úÖ Provider Node Installation (Complete)
- [x] Install Yagna daemon on provider machine (v0.17.3 in Docker)
- [x] Configure provider-specific settings (resources, pricing)
- [x] Set up provider identity and keys (Node ID: `0x536ec34be8b1395d54f69b8895f902f9b65b235b`)
- [x] Configure network connectivity and firewall rules
- [ ] Test basic provider functionality (pending runtime setup)

## üîÑ Initial Configuration (In Progress)
- [x] Set resource limits (CPU: 2 cores, memory: 4GB, disk: 10GB)
- [ ] Configure pricing strategy (competitive but not loss-making)
- [x] Set up payment driver and wallet (Holesky testnet)
- [ ] Configure allowed/blocked requestor lists (if needed)
- [x] Enable provider metrics and logging

## ‚è≥ Validation Testing (Pending)
- [ ] Submit test jobs from our requestor to our own provider
- [ ] Verify end-to-end execution flow works
- [ ] Test our benchmark containers run correctly
- [ ] Validate resource consumption matches expectations
- [ ] Document any container compatibility issues

## üìä Market Research Ready
The provider is connected to the Golem testnet and can begin collecting market intelligence:
- Demand patterns monitoring
- Pricing analysis
- Geographic distribution tracking
- Workload type identification

## üß™ Testing with Runner App
Once runtime setup is complete, test integration:
```bash
# Terminal C: Test job submission
curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/api/v1/jobs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "test-provider-integration",
    "benchmark": {"name": "text-generation"},
    "regions": ["testnet"]
  }'
```
