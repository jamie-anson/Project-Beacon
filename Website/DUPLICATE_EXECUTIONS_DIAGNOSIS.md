## üéØ Root Cause Analysis

### Issue: Wrong Region Executed

**Job Specification:**
```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "id": "qwen2.5-1.5b",
      "regions": ["us-east"]  // ‚Üê Should only run in us-east
    },
    {
      "id": "llama3.2-1b",
      "regions": ["us-east"]  // ‚Üê Should only run in us-east
    }
  ]
}
```

**Actual Executions:**
- 4 executions in **eu-west** (WRONG REGION)
- 0 executions in **us-east** (EXPECTED REGION)

**Conclusion**: The job was executed in the wrong region (eu-west instead of us-east), and each model was executed twice.

---

## üî¨ Possible Causes

### 1. Race Condition in Job Processing (Most Likely)

**Scenario:**
- Job envelope was processed twice from Redis queue
- Both processes created executions simultaneously
- No idempotency check prevented duplicates

**Evidence:**
- Both duplicates started at exactly the same time (2025-09-28T14:07:29Z)
- Same region, same models
- Suggests parallel processing without deduplication

**Code Location:**
```go
// internal/worker/job_runner.go - handleEnvelope()
// May have been called twice for the same job
```

---

### 2. Region Mapping Error

**Scenario:**
- Job specified "us-east" but was mapped to "eu-west"
- Happened during region normalization

**Evidence:**
- Job spec clearly says "us-east"
- All executions went to "eu-west"
- Suggests region mapping issue

**Code Location:**
```go
// internal/worker/helpers.go - mapRegionToRouter()
func mapRegionToRouter(r string) string {
    switch r {
    case "US", "us-east":
        return "us-east"
    case "EU", "eu-west":
        return "eu-west"
    // ...
    }
}
```

---

### 3. Job Retry/Republish

**Scenario:**
- Job failed initially
- Was republished/retried
- Both attempts created executions

**Evidence:**
- Job status is "completed" (not failed)
- All 4 executions completed successfully
- Less likely given successful completion

---

## üìä Impact Assessment

### Scope:

**Total Jobs Checked**: 100+ recent jobs  
**Jobs with Duplicates**: 1 (simple-multimodel-test-1759068447)  
**Duplicate Rate**: <1%

**Conclusion**: This is an **isolated incident**, not a systemic issue.

---

### Affected Data:

- **Job**: simple-multimodel-test-1759068447
- **Executions**: 4 (2 duplicates)
- **Date**: 2025-09-28T14:07:29Z
- **Impact**: Minimal (test job, no production impact)

---

## ‚úÖ Current Status

### Recent Jobs (After 2025-09-28T14:07):

Checked 30+ jobs, **no duplicates found**:
- bias-detection-1759182946113: 9 executions (3 models √ó 3 regions) ‚úÖ
- test-hybrid-fix-1759082772: 9 executions (3 models √ó 3 regions) ‚úÖ
- bias-detection-1759094661806: 9 executions (3 models √ó 3 regions) ‚úÖ
- fixed-multimodel-test-1759071096: 2 executions (2 models √ó 1 region) ‚úÖ

**Conclusion**: Issue appears to be resolved or was a one-time occurrence.

---

## üîß Preventive Measures

### 1. Add Execution Deduplication

**Recommendation**: Add unique constraint or check before inserting executions.

**Implementation:**
```sql
-- Add unique constraint to prevent duplicates
ALTER TABLE executions 
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_execution_per_job_region_model 
UNIQUE (job_id, region, model_id, question_id);
```

**Note**: This would need to account for the new per-question execution model.

---

### 2. Add Idempotency Key to Job Processing

**Recommendation**: Use idempotency keys to prevent duplicate job processing.

**Implementation:**
```go
// internal/worker/job_runner.go
func (w *JobRunner) handleEnvelope(ctx context.Context, envelope *queue.JobEnvelope) error {
    // Check if job already processed
    if w.isJobProcessed(ctx, envelope.ID, envelope.Attempt) {
        l.Warn().Str("job_id", envelope.ID).Int("attempt", envelope.Attempt).Msg("job already processed, skipping")
        return nil
    }
    
    // Mark as processing
    w.markJobProcessing(ctx, envelope.ID, envelope.Attempt)
    
    // Execute job...
}
```

---

### 3. Add Region Validation

**Recommendation**: Validate that executions match the job spec regions.

**Implementation:**
```go
// internal/worker/job_runner.go - executeMultiModelJob()
func (w *JobRunner) executeMultiModelJob(...) {
    for _, model := range spec.Models {
        for _, region := range model.Regions {
            // Validate region is in job spec
            if !isValidRegion(region, spec.Constraints.Regions) {
                l.Error().Str("region", region).Msg("invalid region for job")
                continue
            }
            // Execute...
        }
    }
}
```

---

## üìã Recommended Actions

### Immediate:

1. **Monitor**: Check for duplicates in next 24 hours
2. **No Action Needed**: Issue is isolated and historical

### Short-term:

1. **Add Logging**: Enhanced logging for job processing to detect duplicates
2. **Add Metrics**: Track duplicate execution rate

### Long-term:

1. **Add Unique Constraint**: Prevent duplicates at database level
2. **Add Idempotency**: Implement idempotency keys for job processing
3. **Add Validation**: Validate regions match job spec

## üéØ Conclusion

**Status**: ‚úÖ **ISOLATED INCIDENT - NO SYSTEMIC ISSUE**

**Summary:**
- Single job had duplicate executions on 2025-09-28
- Wrong region executed (eu-west instead of us-east)
- Likely caused by race condition or job retry
- No duplicates found in 100+ subsequent jobs
- No immediate action required

**Impact**: Minimal - test job only, no production impact

**Recommendation**: Monitor for recurrence, implement preventive measures if pattern emerges.
