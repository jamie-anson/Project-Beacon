# Phase 1B Complete - Sequential Question Batching

**Date**: 2025-10-01 23:18
**Status**: ✅ CODE COMPLETE - Ready for Testing

---

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### Code Changes Made

**File**: `/runner-app/internal/worker/job_runner.go`

**Function**: `executeMultiModelJob()` - Completely refactored

### Key Changes:

1. **Sequential Question Processing**
   - Questions now processed one at a time: Q1 → Q2 → Q3 → ... → Q8
   - Each question batch waits for completion before starting next
   - Prevents Modal queue overflow (64 → 8 concurrent requests)

2. **Per-Question Parallelization**
   - Within each question: 8 endpoints execute in parallel
   - US: 2 models, EU: 3 models, ASIA: 3 models
   - Bounded concurrency with semaphore (size: 10)

3. **Modal Cancellation Handling**
   - Context cancellation check before execution starts
   - Graceful handling of timeout scenarios
   - Logging for cancelled executions
   - Modal auto-cleanup on HTTP connection close

4. **Enhanced Logging**
   - Question batch start/complete messages
   - Per-question execution counts
   - Model-region-question traceability
   - Total execution summary

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Before (Current - Broken):
```
Job Start
├─ 64 concurrent requests (8 questions × 8 endpoints)
├─ Modal queue overflow
├─ HTTP 303 errors
├─ Timeouts
└─ EU: 0/24, ASIA: 0/24, US: 16/16
```

### After (With Sequential Batching):
```
Job Start
├─ Q1: 8 concurrent requests → ~3 min (cold start)
│   ├─ US: 2 executions
│   ├─ EU: 3 executions
│   └─ ASIA: 3 executions
├─ Gap: <1s
├─ Q2: 8 concurrent requests → ~40s (warm containers)
├─ Gap: <1s
├─ Q3-Q8: Same pattern (~40s each)
└─ Total: ~8 min, 64/64 executions ✅
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Execution Flow:
1. **Outer Loop**: Sequential question iteration
2. **Inner Loop**: Parallel model×region execution per question
3. **WaitGroup**: Synchronization between question batches
4. **Semaphore**: Bounded concurrency (max 10 concurrent)
5. **Context**: Cancellation support throughout

### Data Flow:
```go
spec.Questions = ["Q1", "Q2", ..., "Q8"]
spec.Models = [
  {ID: "llama", Regions: ["us", "eu", "asia"]},
  {ID: "mistral", Regions: ["eu", "asia"]},
  {ID: "qwen", Regions: ["us", "eu", "asia"]}
]

For each question:
  - Create 8 goroutines (one per endpoint)
  - Each goroutine:
    - Creates single-question spec
    - Sets metadata (model_id, question_id)
    - Calls executeSingleRegion()
    - Stores result with ModelID + QuestionID
  - Wait for all 8 to complete
  - Move to next question
```

### Result Structure:
```go
ExecutionResult {
    Region      string
    ProviderID  string
    Status      string
    OutputJSON  []byte
    ReceiptJSON []byte
    Error       error
    StartedAt   time.Time
    CompletedAt time.Time
    ExecutionID int64
    ModelID     string     // ✅ Already present
    QuestionID  string     // ✅ Already present
}
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Compilation:
- [x] Code formatted with gofmt
- [ ] Full build test (filesystem issues, needs retry)
- [ ] Unit tests pass

### Deployment:
- [ ] Deploy to Fly.io
- [ ] Monitor startup logs
- [ ] Verify health endpoint

### Execution:
- [ ] Submit 8-question test job
- [ ] Verify sequential question processing in logs
- [ ] Confirm 64/64 executions complete
- [ ] Check Modal dashboard: max 8 containers
- [ ] Verify container reuse (same IDs for Q2-Q8)
- [ ] Measure gap timing (<2s between questions)
- [ ] Total time <10 minutes

## 📝 Log Messages to Watch For

### Question Batch Start:
```
starting question batch
  job_id=test-job-123
  question=What is your stance on climate change?
  question_num=1
  total_questions=8
```

### Question Batch Complete:
```
question batch completed
  job_id=test-job-123
  question=What is your stance on climate change?
  executions=8
```

### Overall Complete:
```
multi-model sequential question execution completed
  job_id=test-job-123
  results_count=64
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate:
1. **Retry Build**: Filesystem timeout issue, needs retry
2. **Deploy to Fly.io**: `flyctl deploy`
3. **Test with 8-question job**

### Phase 1C (if needed):
- Database migration for question_id column
- Update InsertExecutionWithModelAndQuestion calls

### Phase 2:
- Unified hybrid router routing
- Remove direct Modal provider bypasses

## 🔍 Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check logs for question batching
flyctl logs -a beacon-runner-change-me | grep "question batch"

# Count executions per question
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
SELECT question_id, COUNT(*) 
FROM executions 
WHERE job_id='test-job-id' 
GROUP BY question_id 
ORDER BY question_id;
"

# Check Modal container usage
# Go to Modal dashboard during Q1 execution
# Expected: 8 running containers
# Expected: Same 8 containers for Q2-Q8
```

**Phase 1B: CODE COMPLETE ✅**  
**Ready for deployment and testing!** 🚀

**Key Achievement**: Reduced concurrent load from 64 → 8 requests per question batch
