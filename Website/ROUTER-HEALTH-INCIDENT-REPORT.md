# Router Health Incident Report

**Incident ID**: router-health-2025-10-22  
**Date**: 2025-10-22  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  
**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Duration**: ~90 minutes  
**MTTR**: 90 minutes

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

**Problem**: All job submissions failing with "No healthy providers available" despite Modal endpoints being operational.

**Root Cause**: Commit `36817cf` incorrectly added `/inference` path to Modal endpoint URLs. Modal functions are deployed at root path, not `/inference`.

**Resolution**: Removed `/inference` path from Modal endpoint construction and increased health check timeout from 30s to 600s (default).

**Impact**: 100% job failure rate for ~90 minutes, blocking all users from submitting bias detection jobs.

## 🎯 Root Cause Analysis

### Immediate Cause

Commit `36817cf` titled "fix: Append /inference path to Modal endpoint URLs" added the following code:

```python
# In hybrid_router/core/router.py (lines 201, 463)
endpoint_url = f"{provider.endpoint}/inference" if provider.type == ProviderType.MODAL else provider.endpoint
```

**Problem**: Modal functions are deployed with FastAPI endpoints at the **root path**, not at `/inference`. The function name is `inference`, but the HTTP endpoint is at the root.

**Modal Deployment Structure**:
```python
# In modal-deployment/modal_hf_us.py
@app.function(...)
@modal.fastapi_endpoint(method="POST")
def inference(item: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # This creates endpoint at ROOT path, not /inference
```

**Result**: Health checks were calling `https://jamie-anson--project-beacon-hf-us-inference.modal.run/inference` which returned 404, causing providers to be marked unhealthy.

### Contributing Factors

1. **Timeout Configuration**: Health check had 30s timeout override, too short for Modal cold starts (2-3 minutes)
2. **Testing Gap**: No integration test to verify Modal endpoint paths before deployment
3. **Confusion**: Modal function name `inference` vs HTTP path (root) caused incorrect assumption

### Why It Wasn't Caught Earlier

- No pre-deployment health check validation
- No integration tests for Modal endpoint paths
- Manual testing didn't catch the path issue before deployment

## 🔧 Resolution Details

### Fix 1: Remove `/inference` Path (Commit `1bbf66a`)

**Changed Files**: `hybrid_router/core/router.py`

**Before**:
```python
endpoint_url = f"{provider.endpoint}/inference" if provider.type == ProviderType.MODAL else provider.endpoint
response = await self.client.post(endpoint_url, json=test_payload, timeout=30.0)
```

**After**:
```python
# Use provider endpoint directly (Modal endpoints are at root path)
response = await self.client.post(provider.endpoint, json=test_payload, timeout=30.0)
```

**Result**: Health checks now call correct URL (root path), US region became healthy immediately.

### Fix 2: Remove 30s Timeout Override (Commit `464e324`)

**Changed Files**: `hybrid_router/core/router.py`

**Before**:
```python
response = await self.client.post(provider.endpoint, json=test_payload, timeout=30.0)
```

**After**:
```python
# Use client's default timeout (600s) to handle Modal cold starts (can be 2-3 minutes)
response = await self.client.post(provider.endpoint, json=test_payload)
```

**Rationale**: According to `docs/sot/timeouts.md`, router HTTP client should use 600s timeout to handle Modal cold starts. The 30s override was too aggressive.

**Result**: EU region can now complete cold starts without timing out (though still takes 2-3 minutes, expected until vLLM implementation).

## ✅ What Went Well

1. ✅ **Diagnostic Plan**: Comprehensive plan with hypothesis ranking helped identify root cause quickly
2. ✅ **Automated Diagnostics**: `diagnose-router-health.sh` script provided clear visibility
3. ✅ **Source of Truth**: `docs/sot/timeouts.md` had correct timeout values documented
4. ✅ **Quick Deployment**: Railway deployment cycle ~90 seconds
5. ✅ **Rollback Strategy**: Clear rollback plan documented (though not needed)

---

## 🔄 What Can Be Improved

### Testing Gaps

1. **Missing Integration Test**: No test to verify Modal endpoint paths
2. **No Pre-Deployment Validation**: Health checks not validated before deployment
3. **Manual Testing**: Relied on manual testing which missed the issue

### Monitoring Gaps

1. **No Health Check Alerts**: No automatic alerts when providers become unhealthy
2. **No Deployment Alerts**: No alerts when deployments cause health check failures
3. **No Timeout Monitoring**: No visibility into health check duration trends

### Documentation Gaps

1. **Modal Endpoint Structure**: Not clearly documented that Modal functions use root path
2. **Timeout Configuration**: SoT exists but not referenced in code comments
3. **Common Failure Patterns**: This incident not yet documented in runbook

### Process Gaps

1. **No Canary Deployment**: All-or-nothing deployment, no gradual rollout
2. **No Automated Rollback**: Manual rollback required
3. **No Pre-Deployment Checks**: No automated validation before going live

## 📚 Lessons Learned

### Technical Lessons

1. **Modal Endpoint Structure**: Modal FastAPI endpoints are at root path, not at function name path
2. **Timeout Configuration**: Always reference SoT for timeout values, don't hardcode
3. **Cold Start Handling**: 2-3 minute cold starts are expected for Modal until vLLM implementation

### Process Lessons

1. **Pre-Deployment Validation**: Always validate health checks before deploying
2. **Integration Testing**: Need tests that verify external service integration
3. **Monitoring First**: Alerts should catch issues before users report them

### Documentation Lessons

1. **Code Comments**: Document non-obvious behavior (e.g., Modal endpoint paths)
2. **SoT References**: Link to SoT in code comments for important configurations
3. **Runbook Updates**: Document incident patterns immediately after resolution
