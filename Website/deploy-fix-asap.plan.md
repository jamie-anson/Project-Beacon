# Deploy Fix ASAP Plan
**Project Beacon - Netlify & GitHub Deployment Resolution**

## 🚨 Current Status
- **Netlify**: Multiple failed deployments with generic "Command failed with exit code 1"
- **GitHub Actions**: Also failing with similar generic errors
- **Local Builds**: Working perfectly (all components build successfully)
- **Issue**: Deployment environment differences causing build failures

---

## 📋 Phase 1: Diagnostic & Root Cause Analysis (30 mins)

### 1.1 Get Detailed Build Logs
- [ ] **Access Netlify build logs** (full logs, not just summary)
- [ ] **Check GitHub Actions logs** for specific error messages
- [ ] **Compare environment differences** between local vs cloud builds
- [ ] **Document exact failure points** from logs

### 1.2 Environment Audit
- [ ] **Node.js version consistency** (local: check `node --version`)
- [ ] **npm version consistency** (local: check `npm --version`)
- [ ] **Memory limits** in cloud environments
- [ ] **Build timeout settings** on Netlify/GitHub
- [ ] **Environment variables** missing or incorrect

### 1.3 Dependency Analysis
- [ ] **Check for platform-specific dependencies** (Mac vs Linux)
- [ ] **Verify all package-lock.json files** are committed and consistent
- [ ] **Audit for missing peer dependencies**
- [ ] **Check for version conflicts** between root and portal dependencies

---

## 🔧 Phase 2: Quick Fixes & Validation (45 mins)

### 2.1 Immediate Fixes
- [ ] **Fix any obvious dependency issues** found in Phase 1
- [ ] **Update Node.js version** to match local environment exactly
- [ ] **Add missing environment variables** to Netlify dashboard
- [ ] **Increase build timeout** if needed (Netlify: Site settings > Build & deploy)

### 2.2 Simplified Build Test
- [ ] **Create minimal build** that only builds docs (skip portal temporarily)
- [ ] **Test with `build:minimal` script** we created
- [ ] **Verify minimal build deploys successfully**
- [ ] **Gradually add components back** (portal, finalization, etc.)

### 2.3 Alternative Deployment Strategy
- [ ] **Set up Vercel as backup** deployment platform
- [ ] **Test same codebase on different platform** to isolate Netlify-specific issues
- [ ] **Compare build environments** between platforms

---

## 🏗️ Phase 3: Robust Build System (60 mins)

### 3.1 Enhanced Error Handling
- [ ] **Implement the detailed logging script** (`scripts/netlify-build.js`)
- [ ] **Add build step validation** (check outputs after each step)
- [ ] **Create build health checks** (verify file sizes, required files exist)
- [ ] **Add retry logic** for network-dependent steps (npm installs)

### 3.2 Build Optimization
- [ ] **Optimize portal build** (reduce chunk sizes, split large components)
- [ ] **Cache optimization** (leverage Netlify build cache effectively)
- [ ] **Parallel builds** where possible (docs + portal simultaneously)
- [ ] **Memory optimization** (already added NODE_OPTIONS, verify effectiveness)

### 3.3 Fallback Strategies
- [ ] **Create emergency deploy script** (minimal viable site)
- [ ] **Set up build notifications** (Slack/email when builds fail)
- [ ] **Document rollback procedures** (revert to last known good commit)

---

## 🧪 Phase 4: Testing & Validation (30 mins)

### 4.1 Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] **Test full build pipeline** end-to-end
- [ ] **Verify all site components** work after deployment
- [ ] **Check WebSocket connections** (Railway integration)
- [ ] **Validate API proxies** (Netlify redirects to Railway)
- [ ] **Test portal functionality** (job creation, bias detection)

### 4.2 Performance Validation
- [ ] **Lighthouse scores** for all major pages
- [ ] **Build time optimization** (target <5 minutes)
- [ ] **Bundle size analysis** (ensure no bloated dependencies)
- [ ] **CDN performance** (verify assets load quickly)

---

## 📚 Phase 5: Documentation & Prevention (15 mins)

### 5.1 Runbook Creation
- [ ] **Document working build process** step-by-step
- [ ] **Create troubleshooting guide** for common build issues
- [ ] **List all environment requirements** (Node, npm, env vars)
- [ ] **Document deployment checklist** for future changes

### 5.2 Monitoring Setup
- [ ] **Set up build status monitoring** (automated alerts)
- [ ] **Create deployment dashboard** (status of all services)
- [ ] **Schedule regular build tests** (weekly full pipeline test)

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Immediate (End of Day 1)
- [ ] **At least one deployment platform working** (Netlify OR Vercel)
- [ ] **All site components accessible** (landing, docs, portal)
- [ ] **API integrations functional** (Railway hybrid router)
- [ ] **WebSocket connections working** (real-time features)

### Long-term (End of Week)
- [ ] **Both platforms working reliably** (primary + backup)
- [ ] **Build time under 5 minutes** consistently
- [ ] **Zero manual intervention required** for standard deployments
- [ ] **Comprehensive monitoring in place** (alerts, dashboards)

---

## 🚀 Emergency Procedures

### If All Else Fails
1. **Manual deployment** to simple hosting (GitHub Pages)
2. **Static export** of critical components only
3. **Temporary subdomain** while fixing main deployment
4. **Rollback to last known good state** (commit hash: `c75dcd3`)

### Escalation Path
1. **Check Netlify Status Page** (platform-wide issues)
2. **Contact Netlify Support** (if platform issue suspected)
3. **Community forums** (Stack Overflow, Netlify Community)
4. **Consider alternative platforms** (Vercel, Railway static, Cloudflare Pages)

## 📞 Resources & Contacts

### Documentation
- **Netlify Build Docs**: https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/
- **Docusaurus Deployment**: https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment
- **Vite Build Guide**: https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html

### Tools
- **Build Log Analysis**: Netlify dashboard > Deploys > [failed deploy] > Deploy log
- **Local Build Testing**: `npm run build` (should match cloud exactly)
- **Dependency Auditing**: `npm audit`, `npm ls --depth=0`

### Backup Plans
- **Vercel**: Ready to deploy same codebase
- **Railway Static**: Can host static builds
- **GitHub Pages**: Emergency fallback for docs only
