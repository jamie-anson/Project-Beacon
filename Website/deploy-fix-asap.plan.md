---

## üìã Phase 1: Fix GitHub API Permission Issues (15 mins) - URGENT

### 1.1 GitHub Actions Permission Errors ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS FIXING
- [x] **Root Cause Identified**: `nwtgck/actions-netlify@v3.0` action failing with "Resource not accessible by integration"
- [x] **Specific Errors**: 
  - Cannot create commit comments (needs `contents: write`)
  - Cannot create deployment records (needs `deployments: write` + `contents: write`)
- [ ] **Fix Required**: Update workflow permissions to include missing permissions

### 1.2 Immediate Actions Required ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] **Locate Workflow File**: ‚úÖ Found `.github/workflows/deploy-website.yml` using `nwtgck/actions-netlify@v3.0` action
- [x] **Update Permissions**: ‚úÖ Added missing permissions to workflow:
  ```yaml
  permissions:
    contents: write          # For commit comments
    deployments: write       # For deployment records  
    statuses: write         # For status updates
    pull-requests: write    # For PR comments
  ```
- [x] **Test Fix**: ‚úÖ Triggered new deployment (run 17829110630) - successful
- [x] **Validate**: ‚úÖ Commit comments and deployment records created successfully

### 1.3 Expected Outcome ‚úÖ ACHIEVED
- ‚úÖ Deployment succeeds (already working)
- ‚úÖ Commit comments created with deployment URLs
- ‚úÖ GitHub deployment records created
- ‚úÖ No more "Resource not accessible by integration" errors

### üéâ VERIFICATION RESULTS
**Latest Deployment (run 17829110630):**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Successful - all steps completed
- **Netlify URLs**: 
  - Production: https://projectbeacon.netlify.app ‚úÖ
  - Preview: https://68cbffbde2e6d34321526f26--projectbeacon.netlify.app ‚úÖ
- **Commit Comment**: ‚úÖ Created successfully (ID: 166052608)
- **Deployment Record**: ‚úÖ Created successfully (ID: 3026689250)
- **GitHub API Errors**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - No permission errors found

---

- [x] **Verify commit comments** appear on deployment commits ‚úÖ WORKING
- [x] **Check deployment records** in GitHub repository deployments tab ‚úÖ CREATED
- [x] **Document fix** in deployment troubleshooting guide ‚úÖ DOCUMENTED

### 1.2 Environment Audit
- [ ] **Node.js version consistency** (local: check `node --version`)
- [ ] **npm version consistency** (local: check `npm --version`)
- [ ] **Memory limits** in cloud environments
- [ ] **Build timeout settings** on Netlify/GitHub
- [ ] **Environment variables** missing or incorrect

### 1.3 Dependency Analysis
- [ ] **Check for platform-specific dependencies** (Mac vs Linux)
- [ ] **Verify all package-lock.json files** are committed and consistent
- [ ] **Audit for missing peer dependencies**
- [ ] **Check for version conflicts** between root and portal dependencies

---

## üîß Phase 2: Quick Fixes & Validation (45 mins)

### 2.1 Immediate Fixes
- [ ] **Fix any obvious dependency issues** found in Phase 1
- [ ] **Update Node.js version** to match local environment exactly
- [ ] **Add missing environment variables** to Netlify dashboard
- [ ] **Increase build timeout** if needed (Netlify: Site settings > Build & deploy)

### 2.2 Simplified Build Test
- [ ] **Create minimal build** that only builds docs (skip portal temporarily)
- [ ] **Test with `build:minimal` script** we created
- [ ] **Verify minimal build deploys successfully**
- [ ] **Gradually add components back** (portal, finalization, etc.)

### 2.3 Alternative Deployment Strategy
- [ ] **Set up Vercel as backup** deployment platform
- [ ] **Test same codebase on different platform** to isolate Netlify-specific issues
- [ ] **Compare build environments** between platforms

---

## üèóÔ∏è Phase 3: Robust Build System (60 mins)

### 3.1 Enhanced Error Handling
- [ ] **Implement the detailed logging script** (`scripts/netlify-build.js`)
- [ ] **Add build step validation** (check outputs after each step)
- [ ] **Create build health checks** (verify file sizes, required files exist)
- [ ] **Add retry logic** for network-dependent steps (npm installs)

### 3.2 Build Optimization
- [ ] **Optimize portal build** (reduce chunk sizes, split large components)
- [ ] **Cache optimization** (leverage Netlify build cache effectively)
- [ ] **Parallel builds** where possible (docs + portal simultaneously)
- [ ] **Memory optimization** (already added NODE_OPTIONS, verify effectiveness)

### 3.3 Fallback Strategies
- [ ] **Create emergency deploy script** (minimal viable site)
- [ ] **Set up build notifications** (Slack/email when builds fail)
- [ ] **Document rollback procedures** (revert to last known good commit)

---

## üß™ Phase 4: Testing & Validation (30 mins)

### 4.1 Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] **Test full build pipeline** end-to-end
- [ ] **Verify all site components** work after deployment
- [ ] **Check WebSocket connections** (Railway integration)

- [ ] **Test portal functionality** (job creation, bias detection)

### 4.2 Performance Validation
- [ ] **Lighthouse scores** for all major pages
- [ ] **Build time optimization** (target <5 minutes)
- [ ] **Bundle size analysis** (ensure no bloated dependencies)
- [ ] **CDN performance** (verify assets load quickly)

---

## üìö Phase 5: Documentation & Prevention (15 mins)

### 5.1 Runbook Creation
- [ ] **Document working build process** step-by-step
- [ ] **Create troubleshooting guide** for common build issues
- [ ] **List all environment requirements** (Node, npm, env vars)
- [ ] **Document deployment checklist** for future changes

### 5.2 Monitoring Setup
- [ ] **Set up build status monitoring** (automated alerts)
- [ ] **Create deployment dashboard** (status of all services)
- [ ] **Schedule regular build tests** (weekly full pipeline test)

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

### Immediate (End of Day 1) ‚úÖ ACHIEVED
