# Phase 1 Deployment Summary - 2025-10-06

**Date**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Production Deployment - 2025-10-01

## ✅ DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE

**Time**: 23:21 UTC  
**Status**: Production Ready  
**Deployment**: https://beacon-runner-change-me.fly.dev

## 🚀 What Was Deployed

### Phase 1A: Strategic Model Distribution
**Modal Deployments** - All 3 regions updated:
- ✅ US (West): llama3.2-1b, qwen2.5-1.5b (2 models)
- ✅ EU (Central): llama3.2-1b, mistral-7b, qwen2.5-1.5b (3 models)
- ✅ ASIA (East): llama3.2-1b, mistral-7b, qwen2.5-1.5b (3 models)
- **Total**: 8 endpoints (exactly at limit) ✅

### Phase 1B: Sequential Question Batching
**Runner App** - Core execution logic refactored:
- ✅ Questions processed sequentially (Q1 → Q2 → ... → Q8)
- ✅ 8 concurrent requests per question (down from 64)
- ✅ Modal cancellation handling on timeout
- ✅ Enhanced logging for question batches
- ✅ Container reuse optimization

---

## 📊 Expected Performance

### Before (Broken):
```
64 concurrent requests → Modal overflow
EU: 0/24 ❌
ASIA: 0/24 ❌
US: 16/16 ✅
Total: 16/64 executions (25% success rate)
```

### After (Fixed):
```
8 concurrent requests per question → Modal handles gracefully
Q1: ~3 min (cold start, 8 containers)
Q2-Q8: ~40s each (warm containers)
Total: ~8 min for 64 executions
Expected: 64/64 ✅ (100% success rate)
```

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Infrastructure:
- [x] Modal US deployed: 2 models
- [x] Modal EU deployed: 3 models
- [x] Modal ASIA deployed: 3 models
- [x] Runner deployed to Fly.io
- [x] Health endpoint responding
- [x] All services healthy

### Code Changes:
- [x] Sequential question loop implemented
- [x] Modal cancellation handling added
- [x] Enhanced logging for question batches
- [x] ExecutionResult.QuestionID field present
- [x] Code formatted and validated

### Testing (Pending):
- [ ] Submit 8-question test job
- [ ] Verify sequential processing in logs
- [ ] Confirm 64/64 executions complete
- [ ] Check Modal dashboard: max 8 containers
- [ ] Verify container reuse for Q2-Q8
- [ ] Measure gap timing (<2s between questions)
- [ ] Total execution time <10 minutes

## 📝 Log Messages to Watch For

When testing, look for these in `flyctl logs -a beacon-runner-change-me`:

### Question Batch Start:
```
starting multi-model sequential question execution
  job_id=...
  model_count=3
  question_count=8
  total_executions=64
  max_concurrent=10
```

### Per-Question:
```
starting question batch
  job_id=...
  question=What is your stance on climate change?
  question_num=1
  total_questions=8

question batch completed
  job_id=...
  question=What is your stance on climate change?
  executions=8
```

### Completion:
```
multi-model sequential question execution completed
  job_id=...
  results_count=64
```

## 🔍 Verification Commands

### Check Deployment:
```bash
# Health check
curl https://beacon-runner-change-me.fly.dev/health | jq .

# Monitor logs
flyctl logs -a beacon-runner-change-me --follow

# Filter for question batching
flyctl logs -a beacon-runner-change-me | grep "question batch"
```

### Check Modal:
```bash
# US endpoint
curl https://jamie-anson--project-beacon-hf-us-health.modal.run | jq .models_available

# EU endpoint
curl https://jamie-anson--project-beacon-hf-eu-health.modal.run | jq .models_available

# ASIA endpoint
curl https://jamie-anson--project-beacon-hf-apac-health.modal.run | jq .models_available
```

### Check Database (after test job):
```sql
-- Count executions by question
SELECT question_id, COUNT(*) as count
FROM executions
WHERE job_id = 'YOUR_TEST_JOB_ID'
GROUP BY question_id
ORDER BY question_id;

-- Expected: 8 rows, each with count=8
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Testing:
1. **Submit 8-question test job via portal**
2. **Monitor logs for sequential batching**
3. **Verify all 64 executions complete**
4. **Check Modal dashboard during execution**

### Phase 1C (If Needed):
- Database migration for question_id column
- Update any queries that need question_id

### Phase 2 (Future):
- Unified hybrid router routing
- Remove direct Modal provider bypasses
- Consistent error handling across regions

## 📈 Key Achievements

1. **Endpoint Optimization**: 8 endpoints (2+3+3) at exact limit
2. **Concurrency Fix**: 64 → 8 concurrent requests per question
3. **Geographic Strategy**: West (US) vs Central (EU) vs East (ASIA)
4. **Cost Optimization**: Container reuse across 8 questions
5. **Cancellation Handling**: Graceful timeout management
6. **Enhanced Observability**: Question-level logging

## 🚨 Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If issues arise:

```bash
# Revert runner code
cd runner-app
git checkout HEAD~1 -- internal/worker/job_runner.go
flyctl deploy

# Revert Modal deployments
cd modal-deployment
git checkout HEAD~1 -- modal_hf_*.py
modal deploy modal_hf_us.py
modal deploy modal_hf_eu.py
modal deploy modal_hf_apac.py
```

**Deployment Status**: ✅ PRODUCTION READY  
**Ready for**: 8-question test job execution  
**Expected Result**: 64/64 executions complete in ~8 minutes  

🚀 **Let's test it!**
