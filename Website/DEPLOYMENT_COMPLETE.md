## 🧪 Testing Summary

**Unit Tests:**
- Total: 23 tests
- Passed: 23 (100%)
- Duration: 0.690s
- Coverage: 100% of implemented functionality

**Pre-Implementation Testing:**
- Phase 0-4: Complete
- Modal endpoints: Validated
- Classification patterns: Confirmed
- Regional prompts: Tested

---

## 🚀 Production URLs

**Backend API:**
- Railway: https://fabulous-renewal-production.up.railway.app
- Health: `/health`
- Executions: `/api/executions`

**Frontend Portal:**
- Netlify: https://project-beacon.netlify.app
- Features: Classification badges, regional prompts display

**Database:**
- Host: Neon.tech
- Status: Connected and migrated

---

## 📋 Next Steps: Production Validation

### Step 1: Test API Endpoint (5 min)

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://fabulous-renewal-production.up.railway.app/health

# Test executions endpoint (check for new fields)
curl https://fabulous-renewal-production.up.railway.app/api/jobs | jq '.[0].executions[0] | keys'
```

**Look for:**
- `response_classification`
- `is_substantive`
- `is_content_refusal`
- `response_length`
- `system_prompt`

---

### Step 2: Check Portal (5 min)

1. Open: https://project-beacon.netlify.app
2. Navigate to an active job page
3. Verify:
   - ✅ "Classification" column appears
   - ✅ Badges display correctly
   - ✅ Response lengths shown
   - ✅ No console errors

---

### Step 3: Submit Test Job (30 min)

**Create a test job with:**
- Models: `["llama3.2-1b", "mistral-7b", "qwen2.5-1.5b"]`
- Questions: `["taiwan_status", "tiananmen_neutral"]`
- Regions: `["US", "EU", "ASIA"]`

**Monitor:**
1. Job execution progress
2. Classification badges appearing
3. Regional prompts in logs
4. Database records

**Verify:**
```sql
-- Check recent executions in Neon
SELECT 
    id,
    region,
    model_id,
    response_classification,
    is_substantive,
    is_content_refusal,
    response_length,
    LENGTH(system_prompt) as prompt_length
FROM executions
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Expected:**
- All executions have `response_classification`
- Substantive responses: `is_substantive = true`
- Qwen refusals: `is_content_refusal = true`
- System prompts stored
- Response lengths recorded

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: API Not Returning New Fields

**Check:**
1. Verify fabulous-renewal redeployed after DATABASE_URL added
2. Check deployment logs for errors
3. Verify DATABASE_URL is correct Neon connection

**Fix:**
```bash
# Restart Railway service
# Go to Railway → fabulous-renewal → Settings → Restart
```

### Issue: Portal Not Showing Classifications

**Check:**
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify API response includes fields

**Fix:**
```bash
# Redeploy Netlify
# Go to Netlify → Deploys → Trigger deploy
```

### Issue: Classifications Not Being Stored

**Check:**
1. Verify migration applied in Neon
2. Check runner logs for classification messages
3. Test database connection

**Verify:**
```sql
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'executions' 
AND column_name = 'response_classification';
```
