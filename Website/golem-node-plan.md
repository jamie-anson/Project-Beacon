# Golem Provider Node — Research Plan

Purpose: Run a Golem provider node to understand the provider experience, validate our benchmark containers, and gather market intelligence for better requestor logic.

## Goals
- **Provider UX insights**: onboarding, operations, monitoring, troubleshooting
- **Technical validation**: test our containers in real Golem runtime environment
- **Market intelligence**: pricing, demand patterns, geographic distribution
- **Competitive analysis**: what workloads are running, execution patterns

---

## Phase 1: Testnet Provider Setup

### Prerequisites
- [x] Hardware selection (see Hardware Requirements below)
- [x] Basic understanding of Golem provider requirements
- [x] Testnet GLM tokens for staking/operations
- [x] Monitoring infrastructure ready

### Hardware Requirements

#### Minimum Specs (Testnet/Research)
- **CPU**: 2-4 cores (modern x86_64)
- **RAM**: 4-8GB (provider overhead + container execution)
- **Storage**: 50-100GB SSD (Yagna, logs, container images)
- **Network**: Stable broadband (10+ Mbps up/down)
- **OS**: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian, CentOS) or macOS

#### Recommended Specs (Production)
- **CPU**: 4-8 cores
- **RAM**: 16-32GB 
- **Storage**: 200-500GB SSD
- **Network**: Dedicated/business connection with static IP
- **Uptime**: 99%+ availability

#### Deployment Options

**Option A: Laptop (Phase 1 Validation)**
- ✅ Quick setup, no additional costs, easy debugging
- ❌ Limited uptime, shared resources, network changes
- **Use case**: Initial container validation and basic functionality testing

**Option B: Cloud Server (Phase 2+ Market Research)**
- ✅ 24/7 uptime, static IP, consistent performance, scalable
- ❌ Monthly costs ($20-100/month), remote maintenance
- **Use case**: Continuous market research and production earnings
- **Recommended**: DigitalOcean/Linode/AWS t3.medium or equivalent

#### Uptime Requirements
- **Testnet/Research**: Can run intermittently, but longer uptime = more market data
- **Production**: Should run 24/7 for reputation and earnings
- **Staking**: GLM tokens are locked while provider is active

### Provider Node Installation
- [x] Install Yagna daemon on provider machine
- [x] Configure provider-specific settings (resources, pricing)
- [x] Set up provider identity and keys
- [x] Configure network connectivity and firewall rules
- [x] Test basic provider functionality

### Initial Configuration
- [x] Set resource limits (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- [x] Configure pricing strategy (competitive but not loss-making)
- [x] Set up payment driver and wallet
- [x] Configure allowed/blocked requestor lists (if needed)
- [x] Enable provider metrics and logging

### Validation Testing
- [x] Submit test jobs from our requestor to our own provider
- [x] Verify end-to-end execution flow works
- [x] Test our benchmark containers run correctly
- [x] Validate resource consumption matches expectations
- [x] Document any container compatibility issues

## Phase 2: Market Research & Monitoring

### Provider-Side Monitoring
- [x] Set up comprehensive logging for all provider operations
- [x] Monitor resource utilization during task execution
- [x] Track payment flows and settlement timing
- [x] Log all incoming demands and negotiation outcomes
- [x] Monitor network connectivity and performance

### Market Analysis
- [x] Document demand patterns (time of day, workload types)
- [x] Analyze pricing trends and competitive positioning
- [x] Track geographic distribution of requestors
- [x] Identify common container images and execution patterns
- [x] Monitor provider network health and participation
