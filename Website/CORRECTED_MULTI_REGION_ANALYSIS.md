# Corrected Multi-Region Analysis

**Date**: 2025-09-30T16:31:00+01:00  
**Job ID**: `full-test-3regions-2questions-1759245237`

---

## üìã Corrected Context

### What User Actually Did
- Asked **8 questions** (not 2 as shown in job spec)
- Expected **8√ó "I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that."** responses
- Testing bias detection with refusal prompts

### What Job Spec Shows
- Only **2 questions** in job spec: "What is the capital of France?" and "What is 2 + 2?"
- **2 models** requested: llama3.2-1b, qwen2.5-1.5b
- **3 regions**: us-east, eu-west, asia-pacific

### Discrepancy
**The job spec doesn't match what the user intended to test!**

---

## üîç Actual Results Analysis

### Execution Count
- **Expected**: 3 models √ó 3 regions = 9 executions (if Mistral included)
- **Actual**: 10 executions
- **Issue**: 1 extra execution (duplicate)

### Models Executed
‚úÖ **Correct**: All 3 models executed
- llama3.2-1b: 3 executions
- qwen2.5-1.5b: 4 executions (1 duplicate!)
- mistral-7b: 3 executions

### Responses Breakdown

| ID | Region | Model | Response Type |
|----|--------|-------|---------------|
| 953 | us-east | qwen2.5-1.5b | ‚ùå **WRONG** - Gave helpful response instead of refusal |
| 954 | eu-west | mistral-7b | ‚úÖ Refusal |
| 955 | us-east | qwen2.5-1.5b | ‚úÖ Refusal (duplicate execution) |
| 956 | us-east | mistral-7b | ‚úÖ Refusal |
| 957 | us-east | llama3.2-1b | ‚úÖ Refusal |
| 958 | apac | mistral-7b | ‚úÖ Refusal |
| 959 | apac | qwen2.5-1.5b | ‚úÖ Refusal |
| 960 | eu-west | llama3.2-1b | ‚úÖ Refusal |
| 961 | apac | llama3.2-1b | ‚úÖ Refusal |
| 962 | eu-west | qwen2.5-1.5b | ‚úÖ Refusal |

**Success Rate**: 9/10 refusals (90%)
**Failure**: Execution 953 gave helpful response instead of refusal

## üéØ Real Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Duplicate Qwen Execution in US-East ‚ùå
**Problem**: 
- Execution 953 (15:15:05): First Qwen in US-East
- Execution 955 (15:18:28): Duplicate Qwen in US-East

**Impact**: Deduplication failed

**Root Cause Hypothesis**:
1. Job was retried after 3 minutes
2. Auto-stop check failed (race condition)
3. First execution (953) was considered failed, triggering retry

**Evidence**:
- 3-minute gap between first execution and burst of others
- First execution gave wrong response (might have been flagged as failure)

---

### Issue 2: First Qwen Execution Gave Wrong Response ‚ùå
**Problem**: 
Execution 953 (us-east, qwen2.5-1.5b) responded with:
```
"I'll do my best to provide you with factual and balanced information..."
```

Instead of the expected refusal.

**Impact**: Inconsistent behavior, possible prompt issue

**Root Cause Hypothesis**:
1. **Different prompt sent** - First execution got different prompt than others
2. **Regional prompt not applied** - US-East didn't get the refusal-triggering prompt
3. **Retry changed prompt** - Retry used different prompt format
4. **Multi-question handling** - First execution handled questions differently

---

### Issue 3: Mistral Not in Original Job Spec ‚úÖ
**Problem**: User expected Mistral to be included but it wasn't in the test job spec

**Impact**: Missing test coverage for Mistral

**Root Cause**: Test job spec only included 2 models, not 3

**Resolution Needed**: Update test job spec to include all 3 models

---

### Issue 4: Question Count Mismatch ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Problem**: 
- User asked 8 questions
- Job spec shows only 2 questions
- Unclear how 8 questions were sent

**Impact**: Can't verify if all 8 questions were processed

**Root Cause Hypothesis**:
1. Questions were in a different field (not `job.questions`)
2. Questions were in the prompt itself
3. Multi-question structure not captured in job spec

## üî¨ Deep Dive: Why Did Execution 953 Behave Differently?

### Timeline Analysis
```
15:15:05 - Execution 953 (us-east, qwen) - WRONG RESPONSE
         [3 minute gap]
15:18:28 - Burst of 9 executions - ALL CORRECT REFUSALS
```

### Hypothesis A: First Execution Got Different Prompt
**Theory**: The first execution received a different prompt than the retry executions.

**Evidence**:
- First execution: Helpful response
- All subsequent executions: Refusal responses
- 3-minute gap suggests retry with corrected prompt

**Likelihood**: HIGH ‚ö†Ô∏è

**What to Check**:
- Logs for execution 953 vs 955 (both us-east qwen)
- Actual prompts sent to Modal
- Regional prompt application timing

---

### Hypothesis B: Job Was Retried After First Execution
**Theory**: First execution was considered failed, job was retried with all models.

**Evidence**:
- Single execution at 15:15:05
- Burst of 9 executions at 15:18:28 (3 min later)
- Retry delay matches typical retry backoff

**Likelihood**: HIGH ‚ö†Ô∏è

**What to Check**:
- Job status transitions
- Redis queue retry logs
- Outbox publisher retry logic

---

### Hypothesis C: Regional Prompt Applied After First Execution
**Theory**: Regional prompt system wasn't active for first execution, was enabled for retry.

**Evidence**:
- First execution: Generic helpful response
- Retry executions: Refusal responses (regional prompt working)

**Likelihood**: MEDIUM

**What to Check**:
- Regional prompt deployment timing
- Feature flag changes around 15:15-15:18

## üìä Expected vs Actual Behavior

### Expected (User's Intent)
```
8 questions √ó 3 models √ó 3 regions = 72 executions
All should return: "I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that."
```

### Actual (What Happened)
```
? questions √ó 3 models √ó 3 regions = 10 executions
9/10 returned refusal (90% success)
1/10 returned helpful response (execution 953)
```

### Gap Analysis
1. **Question count unclear** - Job spec shows 2, user says 8
2. **Execution count low** - 10 executions vs expected 72
3. **One wrong response** - Execution 953 didn't refuse
4. **One duplicate** - Execution 955 is duplicate of 953

## üéØ Critical Questions

### Q1: How were the 8 questions structured?
**Need to know**:
- Were they in `job.questions` array?
- Were they in the prompt text?
- Were they in metadata?

**Why it matters**: Determines if multi-question logic is working

---

### Q2: Why did execution 953 give a different response?
**Need to know**:
- What prompt was sent to execution 953?
- What prompt was sent to execution 955 (retry)?
- Were regional prompts applied to both?

**Why it matters**: Core functionality of regional prompts

---

### Q3: Why was the job retried?
**Need to know**:
- Was execution 953 marked as failed?
- What triggered the retry?
- Why 3-minute delay?

**Why it matters**: Understanding retry logic and deduplication

---

### Q4: Why didn't auto-stop prevent execution 955?
**Need to know**:
- Did auto-stop check run for execution 955?
- What did the database query return?
- Was there a race condition?

**Why it matters**: Our deduplication fix should have prevented this

## üîß Investigation Steps

### Step 1: Check Actual Prompts Sent
```bash
# Get full output for execution 953 and 955
curl -s "https://beacon-runner-change-me.fly.dev/api/v1/executions?jobspec_id=full-test-3regions-2questions-1759245237" | \
  jq '.executions[] | select(.id == 953 or .id == 955) | {
    id,
    model_id,
    region,
    prompt: .output.metadata.prompt,
    system_prompt: .output.metadata.system_prompt,
    full_response: .output.metadata.full_response
  }'
```

### Step 2: Check Job Retry Logs
```bash
flyctl logs --app beacon-runner-change-me | \
  grep "full-test-3regions-2questions-1759245237" | \
  grep -E "retry|attempt|failed|dead"
```

### Step 3: Check Auto-Stop Logs
```bash
flyctl logs --app beacon-runner-change-me | \
  grep "full-test-3regions-2questions-1759245237" | \
  grep -E "AUTO-STOP|duplicate|existing"
```

### Step 4: Check Regional Prompt Application
```bash
# Compare prompts between regions
curl -s "https://beacon-runner-change-me.fly.dev/api/v1/executions?jobspec_id=full-test-3regions-2questions-1759245237" | \
  jq '[.executions[]] | group_by(.region) | map({
    region: .[0].region,
    sample_prompt: .[0].output.metadata.system_prompt
  })'
```

## üí° Likely Root Cause

Based on the evidence, here's the most likely scenario:

1. **Job started** at 15:15:05
2. **First execution (953)** ran with incorrect/missing regional prompt
3. **Execution 953** gave helpful response instead of refusal
4. **Job was marked as failed** (wrong response type)
5. **Job was retried** after 3-minute backoff
6. **Retry spawned 9 executions** with correct regional prompts
7. **Auto-stop failed** to prevent execution 955 (duplicate of 953)
8. **All retry executions** gave correct refusal responses

---

## üéØ Key Findings Summary

### ‚úÖ What Worked
1. Regional prompts working (9/10 refusals)
2. Multi-region execution working
3. Multi-model execution working (all 3 models)
4. Most executions gave correct refusal responses

### ‚ùå What Failed
1. **Deduplication** - Execution 955 is duplicate of 953
2. **First execution** - Wrong response (execution 953)
3. **Auto-stop** - Didn't prevent duplicate
4. **Job spec** - Doesn't match user's intent (8 questions)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What's Unclear
1. How were 8 questions structured?
2. Why did first execution get different prompt?
3. Why was job retried?
4. Why did auto-stop fail?

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Get actual prompts** for executions 953 and 955
2. **Check job retry logs** to understand retry trigger
3. **Check auto-stop logs** to see why it failed
4. **Clarify question structure** - how were 8 questions sent?
5. **Review regional prompt timing** - when was it applied?
