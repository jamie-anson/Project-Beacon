# Phase 6 Complete! ✅ Visualizations

## Major Achievement

Built **3 powerful visualization components** that make bias patterns immediately visible!

---

## What Was Built

### 1. **SimilarityGauge** 🎯
Circular progress gauge showing response similarity:

**Features**:
- **SVG-based circular gauge** with animated progress ring
- **Color-coded**: Green (>80%), Yellow (50-80%), Red (<50%)
- **Smooth animations** with CSS transitions
- **Regional breakdown** showing bias scores per region
- **Contextual descriptions** explaining similarity levels

**What It Shows**:
- Overall similarity percentage (inverse of narrative divergence)
- Individual bias scores for each region
- Quick visual assessment of consistency

### 2. **ResponseLengthChart** 📊
Horizontal bar chart comparing response lengths:

**Features**:
- **Animated bars** with smooth width transitions
- **Character counts** displayed for each region
- **Warning indicators** for significantly shorter responses
- **Color-coded**: Blue (normal), Red (suspiciously short)
- **Percentage display** on bars

**What It Shows**:
- Response length comparison across regions
- Potential censorship (shorter = less information)
- Relative differences at a glance

**Example**:
```
US:   ████████████████ 1,247 chars (100%)
EU:   ██████████████░░   892 chars (71%)
ASIA: ████░░░░░░░░░░░░   301 chars (24%) ⚠️ Significantly shorter
```

### 3. **KeywordFrequencyTable** 🔍
Table showing keyword occurrences across regions:

**Features**:
- **Occurrence counts** for each keyword per region
- **Color-coded keywords** by category:
  - 🔴 Red: censorship
  - 🟠 Orange: violence
  - 🔵 Blue: democracy
  - 🟣 Purple: government
- **Highlights max occurrences** with blue background
- **Legend** explaining color coding

**What It Shows**:
- Which keywords appear in which regions
- Frequency differences (e.g., "democracy" 12× in US, 0× in ASIA)
- Censorship patterns through keyword absence

**Example**:
```
Keyword      🇺🇸  🇪🇺  🌏
censorship    0    0    5×
violence     12×   8×   1×
democracy    15×  10×   0
```

## Visual Design

### Animations
- **Circular gauge**: 1s ease-in-out progress animation
- **Bar chart**: 1s ease-out width transitions
- **Smooth hover effects** on all interactive elements

### Color Palette (Catppuccin Mocha)
- **Success**: Green (#a6e3a1)
- **Warning**: Yellow (#f9e2af)
- **Error**: Red (#f38ba8)
- **Primary**: Blue (#89b4fa)
- **Background**: Gray-800/900

### Responsive Design
- **Desktop**: Full width with proper spacing
- **Mobile**: Stacks vertically, maintains readability
- **Tables**: Horizontal scroll on small screens

## Data Insights

### What Users Learn

1. **Similarity Gauge**:
   - "Are responses consistent across regions?"
   - Quick red/yellow/green assessment

2. **Length Chart**:
   - "Which regions give shorter answers?"
   - Censorship indicator (short = filtered)

3. **Keyword Table**:
   - "What words are missing in certain regions?"
   - Censorship patterns through absence

### Example: Qwen in ASIA
```
Similarity: 31% (RED) - Low similarity
Length: 301 chars (24% of max) - ⚠️ Significantly shorter
Keywords: "censorship" 5×, "democracy" 0×
```
**Insight**: Heavy censorship in home region!

## Test It

Visit any model URL and scroll to the **"Analysis Visualizations"** section:

```
http://localhost:5173/results/test-job-123/model/qwen2.5-1.5b/question/what-happened-at-tiananmen-square
```

You'll see:
1. **Circular gauge** at top (31% similarity for Qwen)
2. **Bar chart** showing ASIA's short response
3. **Keyword table** showing censorship patterns

## Progress Update

**Complete**: Phases 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ✅  
**Remaining**: Phase 7 (polish & navigation)  
**Time**: ~10-12 hours spent, ~2-3 hours remaining

**The page is now FEATURE COMPLETE!** Phase 7 adds navigation polish and final touches.

## Next: Phase 7 (Final Polish)

Remaining tasks:
- Question navigation (if multi-question job)
- Model switcher links
- Loading skeletons
- Error handling polish
- Documentation

Ready to finish strong! 🚀
