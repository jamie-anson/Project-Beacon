# Phase 1B & 1C Fixes - DEPLOYED

**Date**: 2025-10-02 00:40 UTC  
**Status**: 🚀 DEPLOYING TO PRODUCTION

---

## 🎯 Summary

Implemented critical fixes for two bugs discovered during Modal optimization testing:
1. **Phase 1B**: Modal queue zombies (requests sent after job cancellation)
2. **Phase 1C**: Premature job failure (status calculated before all executions complete)

---

## ✅ Phase 1B: Context Cancellation Between Questions

### Problem
Per-region goroutines continued processing questions even after:
- Context was cancelled
- Other regions failed
- Job timeout occurred

**Result**: Modal received requests 2.5 minutes AFTER job was marked as failed, creating zombie requests.

### Fix Implemented

**Location**: `/runner-app/internal/worker/job_runner.go`

**Change 1: Check context at start of each question loop**
```go
// Process questions sequentially for this region
for questionIdx, question := range spec.Questions {
    // ✅ ADDED: Check if context is cancelled before processing next question
    select {
    case <-ctx.Done():
        l.Warn().
            Str("job_id", jobID).
            Str("region", r).
            Int("question_num", questionIdx+1).
            Int("completed_questions", questionIdx).
            Err(ctx.Err()).
            Msg("stopping region question queue - context cancelled")
        return  // Exit region goroutine immediately
    default:
        // Continue processing
    }
    
    // ... rest of question processing ...
}
```

**Change 2: Check context before spawning model goroutines**
```go
// Check context before spawning goroutine
select {
case <-ctx.Done():
    l.Warn().
        Str("job_id", jobID).
        Str("region", r).
        Str("model_id", model.ID).
        Str("question", question).
        Msg("skipping model execution - context cancelled")
    continue  // Skip this model, don't spawn goroutine
default:
    // Continue
}
```

### Expected Behavior

**Before Fix**:
- US completes Q1 → moves to Q2
- EU fails on Q1
- **US continues to Q2, Q3, Q4...** (zombie requests)
- Modal receives requests after job marked failed

**After Fix**:
- US completes Q1 → starts Q2
- EU fails on Q1 → context cancelled
- **US immediately stops** (no Q2 started)
- No zombie requests sent to Modal

### Logs to Watch For

```
stopping region question queue - context cancelled
  job_id=...
  region=us-east
  question_num=2
  completed_questions=1
  
skipping model execution - context cancelled
  job_id=...
  region=eu-west
  model_id=llama3.2-1b
  question=Q2
```

## ✅ Phase 1C: Enhanced Status Calculation Logging

### Problem
Job status was determined and logged but timing wasn't clear. Users saw "Job Failed" while executions were still completing in the database.

**Note**: The actual issue is NOT in the code (success rate IS calculated after regionWg.Wait()), but in monitoring/logging clarity.

### Fix Implemented

**Change 3: Enhanced logging after all regions complete**
```go
// Wait for all regions to complete their question queues
regionWg.Wait()

l.Info().
    Str("job_id", jobID).
    Int("results_count", len(results)).
    Int("expected_executions", totalExecutions).
    Msg("all region question queues completed - ready for status calculation")
```

**Change 4: Detailed status calculation logging**
```go
l.Info().
    Str("job_id", jobID).
    Int("completed", successCount).
    Int("failed", failureCount).
    Int("total", totalExecutions).
    Float64("success_rate", successRate).
    Float64("min_success_rate", minSuccessRate).
    Str("final_status", jobStatus).
    Msg("calculating final job status after all executions")
```

### Expected Log Sequence

```
[00:00:00] starting multi-model per-region question queue execution
           total_executions=18

[00:01:30] all region question queues completed - ready for status calculation
           results_count=18
           expected_executions=18

[00:01:30] calculating final job status after all executions
           completed=8
           failed=10
           total=18
           success_rate=0.44
           min_success_rate=0.67
           final_status=failed
```

## 📊 Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified
- ✅ `/runner-app/internal/worker/job_runner.go` (3 changes)

### Lines Changed
- **Added**: 30 lines (context checks + enhanced logging)
- **Modified**: 2 lines (log message improvements)

### Functions Updated
1. `executeMultiModelJob()` - Added context checks in region queue loops
2. `processExecutionResults()` - Enhanced status calculation logging

---

## 🧪 Testing Plan

### Manual Test (Required)
1. **Submit 2-question test job** via portal
2. **Monitor Fly.io logs**:
   ```bash
   flyctl logs -a beacon-runner-production --follow | grep -E "(context cancelled|status calculation)"
   ```
3. **Monitor Modal dashboard** at https://modal.com/jamie-anson/project-beacon-hf
4. **Watch for context cancellation messages** when EU fails
5. **Verify no new requests** appear in Modal after failure

### Expected Results

**Phase 1B Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Logs show "stopping region question queue - context cancelled"
- [ ] US stops immediately when EU fails
- [ ] Modal shows NO requests after job cancellation
- [ ] No zombie requests in Modal function calls

**Phase 1C Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Logs show "all region question queues completed" message
- [ ] Status calculation happens AFTER all executions finish
- [ ] Log timing matches last execution completion time
- [ ] No "Job Failed" UI message while executions running
