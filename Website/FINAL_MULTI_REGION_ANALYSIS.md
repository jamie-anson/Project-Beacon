## üéØ Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Duplicate Qwen Execution in US-East ‚ùå

**The Duplicate**:
- **Execution 953**: us-east, qwen2.5-1.5b, created 15:15:05
- **Execution 955**: us-east, qwen2.5-1.5b, created 15:18:28 (DUPLICATE)

**Impact**: 
- Deduplication failed
- Wasted compute
- Database pollution

**Timeline**:
```
15:15:05 - Execution 953 (first qwen in us-east)
         [3 minute 23 second gap]
15:18:28 - Execution 955 (duplicate qwen in us-east)
15:18:28 - Execution 954, 956 (other models/regions)
```

**Root Cause Hypothesis**:
1. **Job retry** - Job was retried after first execution
2. **Auto-stop failed** - Deduplication check didn't prevent execution 955
3. **Race condition** - Both executions checked DB before either inserted

---

### Issue 2: First Execution Gave Wrong Response ‚ùå

**The Problem**:
Execution 953 (us-east, qwen2.5-1.5b) responded:
```
"I'll do my best to provide you with factual and balanced 
information on various topics, including sensitive..."
```

Instead of refusing like all other executions.

**Impact**:
- Inconsistent behavior
- Possible prompt issue
- May have triggered retry

**Comparison**:
| Execution | Region | Model | Response |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------|
| 953 | us-east | qwen | ‚ùå Helpful answer |
| 955 | us-east | qwen | ‚úÖ Refusal (duplicate) |
| 959 | apac | qwen | ‚úÖ Refusal |
| 962 | eu-west | qwen | ‚úÖ Refusal |

**All other Qwen executions refused correctly!**

**Root Cause Hypothesis**:
1. **Different prompt** - Execution 953 got different prompt
2. **Regional prompt not applied** - First execution missed regional prompt
3. **Timing issue** - Regional prompt deployed between 15:15 and 15:18

---

### Issue 3: Region Name Mismatch ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Job Spec Regions**:
- US
- EU
- ASIA

**Actual Execution Regions**:
- us-east
- eu-west
- asia-pacific

**Impact**: 
- Region mapping working correctly
- But inconsistent naming between job spec and executions

**Where Mapping Happens**:
- Runner app maps "US" ‚Üí "us-east"
- Runner app maps "EU" ‚Üí "eu-west"
- Runner app maps "ASIA" ‚Üí "asia-pacific"

## üî¨ Deep Dive: The Duplicate Mystery

### Why Did We Get a Duplicate?

**Our Deduplication Fixes Should Have Prevented This!**

We implemented:
1. ‚úÖ **Input validation** - Deduplicate models array
2. ‚úÖ **Auto-stop check** - Check DB before execution
3. ‚úÖ **Metrics** - Track duplicates

**But execution 955 still happened!**

### Hypothesis A: Auto-Stop Check Failed (Race Condition)

**Theory**: Both executions checked the database before either inserted.

**Timeline**:
```
15:15:05.000 - Execution 953 starts
15:15:05.001 - Execution 953 checks DB: 0 existing ‚Üí proceed
15:15:05.002 - Execution 953 runs inference
15:15:05.XXX - Execution 953 inserts to DB

[3 minute gap - job retry triggered]

15:18:28.000 - Execution 955 starts
15:18:28.001 - Execution 955 checks DB: ??? existing
15:18:28.002 - Execution 955 runs inference (shouldn't happen!)
```

**Question**: What did execution 955's DB check return?

**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (race condition unlikely with 3-minute gap)

---

### Hypothesis B: Job Was Retried (Most Likely)

**Theory**: Execution 953 was considered failed, triggering job retry.

**Evidence**:
1. **3-minute gap** between first execution and retry burst
2. **Wrong response** in execution 953 (might trigger failure)
3. **Burst of 9 executions** at 15:18:28 (typical retry behavior)
4. **All retry executions** gave correct responses

**Retry Trigger**:
- Execution 953 gave wrong response type
- Job marked as failed
- Retry logic kicked in after backoff delay
- Retry spawned all 9 executions (3 models √ó 3 regions)

**Why Auto-Stop Failed**:
- Auto-stop checks for existing executions
- But if job is retried, it might not check previous attempt's executions
- Or execution 953 was marked as failed, so retry considered it "doesn't count"

**Likelihood**: HIGH ‚ö†Ô∏è

---

### Hypothesis C: Different Prompt Caused Different Behavior

**Theory**: Execution 953 received different prompt than retry executions.

**Evidence**:
1. **First execution**: Helpful response
2. **All retry executions**: Refusal responses
3. **Same model/region**: us-east qwen behaved differently

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Regional prompt not deployed yet** at 15:15:05
2. **Regional prompt deployed** between 15:15 and 15:18
3. **Retry used different prompt format**
4. **Feature flag changed** between attempts

**Likelihood**: HIGH ‚ö†Ô∏è

---

## üìä What This Tells Us

### ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **Multi-region execution**: All 3 regions executed ‚úÖ
2. **Multi-model execution**: All 3 models executed ‚úÖ
3. **Regional prompts**: 9/10 executions gave correct refusals ‚úÖ
4. **Infrastructure**: All regions operational ‚úÖ

### ‚ùå What's Broken

1. **Deduplication**: Got 1 duplicate despite our fixes ‚ùå
2. **Auto-stop**: Didn't prevent execution 955 ‚ùå
3. **Consistency**: First execution behaved differently ‚ùå
4. **Retry logic**: May be creating duplicates ‚ùå

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What's Unclear

1. **Why did execution 953 give different response?**
2. **Why was the job retried?**
3. **Why didn't auto-stop prevent execution 955?**
4. **What prompt was sent to execution 953 vs 955?**

## üéØ Critical Questions to Answer

### Q1: What Triggered the Job Retry?

**Need to check**:
- Job status transitions
- Execution 953 status (was it marked failed?)
- Retry logic in outbox publisher
- Redis queue retry logs

**Why it matters**: Understanding retry prevents future duplicates

---

### Q2: Why Did Auto-Stop Fail?

**Need to check**:
- Auto-stop logs for execution 955
- Database query results
- Whether retry logic bypasses auto-stop
- Race condition timing

**Why it matters**: Our deduplication fix should have worked

---

### Q3: What Prompt Was Sent to Execution 953?

**Need to check**:
- Full prompt for execution 953
- Full prompt for execution 955
- System prompt differences
- Regional prompt application timing

**Why it matters**: Explains inconsistent behavior

---

### Q4: How Does Retry Logic Work?

**Need to check**:
- Does retry create new executions or resume old ones?
- Does retry check for existing executions?
- Does retry respect auto-stop checks?
- What's the retry backoff delay?

**Why it matters**: May need to fix retry logic

---

## üîß Investigation Steps

### Step 1: Check Job Retry Logs
```bash
flyctl logs --app beacon-runner-production | \
  grep "bias-detection-1759245498941" | \
  grep -E "retry|attempt|failed|dead|requeue"
```

**Looking for**:
- Retry trigger event
- Reason for retry
- Retry delay timing

---

### Step 2: Check Auto-Stop Logs
```bash
flyctl logs --app beacon-runner-production | \
  grep "bias-detection-1759245498941" | \
  grep -E "AUTO-STOP|duplicate|existing_count"
```

**Looking for**:
- Did auto-stop run for execution 955?
- What did the DB query return?
- Any errors in auto-stop logic?

---

### Step 3: Get Full Prompts
```bash
curl -s "https://beacon-runner-production.fly.dev/api/v1/executions?jobspec_id=bias-detection-1759245498941" | \
  jq '.executions[] | select(.id == 953 or .id == 955) | {
    id,
    region,
    model_id,
    system_prompt: .output.metadata.system_prompt,
    prompt: .output.metadata.prompt,
    full_response: .output.metadata.full_response
  }'
```

**Looking for**:
- Prompt differences between 953 and 955
- Regional prompt presence
- System prompt differences

---

### Step 4: Check Execution 953 Status
```bash
curl -s "https://beacon-runner-production.fly.dev/api/v1/executions?jobspec_id=bias-detection-1759245498941" | \
  jq '.executions[] | select(.id == 953) | {
    id,
    status,
    created_at,
    completed_at,
    output_status: .output.status,
    failure: .output.failure
  }'
```

**Looking for**:
- Was execution 953 marked as failed?
- What was the failure reason?
- Did it trigger retry?

---

## üí° Most Likely Scenario

Based on all evidence, here's what probably happened:

### Timeline Reconstruction

**15:15:05 - First Attempt**
1. Job starts processing
2. Execution 953 (us-east, qwen) spawns
3. Regional prompt NOT YET APPLIED (or wrong prompt sent)
4. Execution 953 gives helpful response instead of refusal
5. Job marked as FAILED (wrong response type)

**15:15:05 to 15:18:28 - Retry Backoff**
6. Job enters retry queue with 3-minute backoff
7. Regional prompt system deployed/fixed during this time

**15:18:28 - Retry Attempt**
8. Job retried with all 9 executions (3 models √ó 3 regions)
9. Regional prompts NOW WORKING correctly
10. All 9 executions give correct refusal responses
11. Auto-stop check DOESN'T prevent execution 955 because:
    - Retry logic doesn't check previous attempt's executions, OR
    - Execution 953 marked as failed, so doesn't count, OR
    - Auto-stop only checks within same job attempt

**Result**:
- 10 total executions (1 from first attempt + 9 from retry)
- 1 duplicate (execution 955 duplicates 953)
- 9/10 correct refusals (only retry executions correct)

---

## üéØ Root Causes Summary

### Root Cause 1: Regional Prompt Timing Issue
**Problem**: Regional prompt not applied to first execution

**Evidence**: Execution 953 gave different response than retry

**Fix Needed**: Ensure regional prompts applied before ANY execution

---

### Root Cause 2: Retry Logic Creates Duplicates
**Problem**: Job retry doesn't check for existing executions from previous attempts

**Evidence**: Execution 955 duplicates 953 despite auto-stop

**Fix Needed**: Retry logic must respect existing executions across attempts

---

### Root Cause 3: Auto-Stop Doesn't Span Job Attempts
**Problem**: Auto-stop only checks current attempt, not previous attempts

**Evidence**: Auto-stop didn't prevent execution 955

**Fix Needed**: Auto-stop must check ALL executions for this job, not just current attempt

---

## üöÄ Recommended Fixes (For Debate)

### Fix 1: Make Auto-Stop Attempt-Agnostic
**Change**: Auto-stop checks for ANY existing execution with (job_id, region, model_id), regardless of attempt

**Impact**: Prevents duplicates across retries

---

### Fix 2: Retry Logic Should Skip Successful Executions
**Change**: When retrying, only re-execute failed/missing (model, region) pairs

**Impact**: Prevents re-executing successful executions

---

### Fix 3: Ensure Regional Prompts Applied Before Execution
**Change**: Add validation that regional prompt is applied before spawning execution

**Impact**: Consistent behavior across all executions

---

### Fix 4: Add Retry Metadata to Executions
**Change**: Track which attempt created each execution

**Impact**: Better debugging and deduplication

---

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Verify hypothesis** - Check logs to confirm retry scenario
2. **Debate fixes** - Discuss which fixes to implement
3. **Implement fixes** - Make changes to prevent future duplicates
4. **Test thoroughly** - Verify fixes work across retries
5. **Monitor** - Watch for duplicates in production
