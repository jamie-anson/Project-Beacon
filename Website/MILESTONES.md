## 🎯 Active Milestones

### M1: Goroutine Coordination Bug Fix ✅ COMPLETED
**Status:** 🟢 SHIPPED  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Completed:** 2025-10-15  
**Plan:** [GOROUTINE-COORDINATION-BUG-FIX-PLAN.md](./GOROUTINE-COORDINATION-BUG-FIX-PLAN.md)

**Objective:** Fix jobs completing before all executions finish

**Deliverables:**
- [x] Root cause identified (timing + barrier query issues)
- [x] Fix implemented (timing correction + barrier query enhancement)
- [x] Deployed to production (`deployment-01K7MAN7ZG53EGEPQ3JTJ2EMRY`)
- [x] Validated with test job (job_id=434)
- [x] Documentation updated (plan + SoT)

**Results:**
- Job completion gap: 83s → 1s ✅
- Barrier correctly waits for all executions ✅
- Timing accuracy improved (no queue time inflation) ✅
- Regional routing working correctly ✅

**Impact:** HIGH - Core product reliability improved

### M2: Timeout Mystery Investigation 🔍 IN PROGRESS
**Status:** 🟡 INVESTIGATING  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Started:** 2025-10-15  
**Plan:** [TIMEOUT-MYSTERY-FIX-PLAN.md](./TIMEOUT-MYSTERY-FIX-PLAN.md)

**Objective:** Resolve 238-second timeout where Modal succeeds but runner receives failure

**Current Phase:** Phase 1 - Investigation

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Check hybrid router logs (Railway)
- [ ] Check runner logs (Fly.io)
- [ ] Verify Modal response details
- [ ] Identify exact timeout source
- [ ] Reproduce issue reliably
- [ ] Implement fix
- [ ] Validate fix

**Blockers:** None

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Affects ~5% of executions (slower models/cold starts)

### M3: Portal UI - Finalizing Status Support 📋 PLANNED
**Status:** ⚪ NOT STARTED  
**Priority:** LOW  
**Dependencies:** M1 (completed)

**Objective:** Add UI support for `finalizing` job status

**Background:** 
The strict completion barrier can set jobs to `finalizing` status when waiting for executions to persist. Portal should handle this gracefully.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add `finalizing` status to Live Progress component
- [ ] Show "Finalizing results..." message
- [ ] Keep progress bars active during finalization
- [ ] Test with barrier-deferred jobs
- [ ] Deploy to production

**Impact:** LOW - Improves UX for edge cases

---

### M4: Retry Status Update Fix 📋 PLANNED
**Status:** ⚪ NOT STARTED  
**Priority:** LOW

**Objective:** Update execution status from `retrying` to `completed` after successful retry

**Background:**
When a retry succeeds, the execution status remains `retrying` in the database even though it has a `completed_at` timestamp. This is cosmetic but should be fixed.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Identify where retry status is set
- [ ] Add status update after successful retry
- [ ] Test retry flow
- [ ] Validate status transitions
- [ ] Deploy fix

**Impact:** LOW - Cosmetic issue, doesn't affect functionality

## 🏁 Completed Milestones

### M0: Multi-Region Execution (Track B) ✅
**Completed:** 2025-01-14  
**Impact:** HIGH - Core product feature

Enabled cross-region bias detection with parallel execution across US/EU/APAC regions.

### M-1: Multi-Model Support (Phase 1) ✅
**Completed:** 2025-01-13  
**Impact:** HIGH - MVP requirement

Added support for multiple models (llama3.2-1b, qwen2.5-1.5b, mistral-7b) in single job.

## 📝 Notes

### Decision Log

**2025-10-15**: Prioritized M1 (goroutine bug) over M2 (timeout) due to higher impact
- M1 affects 100% of multi-region jobs
- M2 affects ~5% of executions
- M1 fix was critical for product reliability

**2025-10-15**: Deferred M3 (portal UI) until M1 validated
- Want to see if `finalizing` status is actually needed in practice
- May not be needed if barrier works well enough

### Risk Register

**R1: Timeout mystery may require infrastructure migration**
- Risk: HIGH
- Impact: MEDIUM
- Mitigation: Have multiple fix options in plan (M2)

**R2: Railway platform limitations**
- Risk: MEDIUM
- Impact: MEDIUM
- Mitigation: Can migrate to Fly.io if needed

**R3: Modal cold start unpredictability**
- Risk: LOW
- Impact: MEDIUM
- Mitigation: Keep-warm strategy available ($87/month)
