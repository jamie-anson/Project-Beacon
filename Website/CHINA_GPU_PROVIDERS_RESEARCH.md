## Technical Integration: Alibaba Cloud Example

### 1. Deploy Model to PAI-EAS

```python
# alibaba_deployment.py
from alibabacloud_pai_eas20210701.client import Client
from alibabacloud_pai_eas20210701.models import CreateServiceRequest

# Initialize client
client = Client(access_key_id='xxx', access_key_secret='xxx')

# Create inference service
request = CreateServiceRequest(
    service_name='project-beacon-llama-china',
    model_path='oss://bucket/llama-3.2-1b',
    instance_type='ecs.gn6i-c4g1.xlarge',  # T4 GPU
    resource={
        'cpu': 4,
        'gpu': 1,
        'memory': 16384
    },
    metadata={
        'region': 'cn-beijing',
        'framework': 'pytorch',
        'runtime': 'python3.9'
    }
)

response = client.create_service(request)
print(f"Endpoint: {response.body.internet_endpoint}")
```

### 2. Update Hybrid Router

```python
# hybrid_router/providers.py

PROVIDERS = {
    # ... existing US/EU providers ...
    
    # China provider
    "provider_china_001": {
        "name": "Alibaba Cloud Beijing",
        "region": "asia-east",
        "endpoint": "https://xxx.pai-eas.aliyuncs.com/api/predict/project-beacon-llama-china",
        "type": "alibaba_eas",
        "models": ["llama3.2-1b", "qwen2.5-1.5b"],
        "auth": {
            "type": "aliyun_signature",
            "access_key_id": os.getenv("ALIBABA_ACCESS_KEY_ID"),
            "access_key_secret": os.getenv("ALIBABA_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET")
        },
        "health_check": "/api/health",
        "timeout": 30
    }
}
```

### 3. Authentication Handler

```python
# hybrid_router/alibaba_auth.py
import hmac
import hashlib
import base64
from datetime import datetime

def sign_alibaba_request(access_key_secret, method, path, headers):
    """Generate Alibaba Cloud signature"""
    timestamp = datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')
    
    string_to_sign = f"{method}\n{path}\n{timestamp}"
    signature = base64.b64encode(
        hmac.new(
            access_key_secret.encode('utf-8'),
            string_to_sign.encode('utf-8'),
            hashlib.sha256
        ).digest()
    ).decode('utf-8')
    
    return {
        'Authorization': f'acs {access_key_id}:{signature}',
        'Date': timestamp
    }
```
