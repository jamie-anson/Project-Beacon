## Why RunPod for APAC?

### ✅ Advantages

1. **75% Faster Cold Starts**
   - Modal: 2-4 seconds
   - RunPod: <500ms
   - Better user experience for first request

2. **15% Cost Savings**
   - $456/year savings
   - Same GPU performance
   - No feature trade-offs

3. **No China ICP License Issues**
   - Singapore region (no ICP needed)
   - Modal APAC also uses Singapore
   - RunPod has more APAC regions available

4. **Container-Based**
   - Easy migration from Modal
   - Same Docker images work
   - Minimal code changes

5. **Low Risk**
   - Modal remains as fallback
   - Gradual rollout (10% → 50% → 100%)
   - Instant rollback capability

### ⚠️ Considerations

1. **Slightly Less Mature**
   - Modal has been around longer
   - RunPod is growing fast
   - Both are production-ready

2. **Smaller Community**
   - Modal has larger community
   - RunPod Discord is active
   - Both have good support

3. **Documentation**

## Why NOT Keep Modal?

### Current Issues with Modal APAC

1. **Slow Cold Starts**
   - 2-4 second cold starts hurt UX
   - Users wait longer for first response
   - RunPod solves this

2. **Higher Cost**
   - 15% more expensive than RunPod
   - $456/year extra cost
   - No performance benefit

3. **Limited Optimization**
   - Modal doesn't offer flex worker discounts
   - RunPod has better pricing tiers
   - Cost optimization matters at scale

## Recommendation

### ✅ Migrate to RunPod

**Reasons:**
1. 75% faster cold starts (major UX improvement)
2. 15% cost savings ($456/year)
3. Low migration risk (Modal fallback)
4. Easy migration (container-based)
5. Better performance at lower cost

**Timeline:**
- Day 1: Build images (2-3 hours)
- Day 2: Deploy & test (1 hour)
- Day 3-5: Gradual rollout (10% → 50% → 100%)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Keep Modal as fallback
- Gradual rollout with monitoring
- Instant rollback capability
- No downtime expected

## Alternative: Keep Modal

**Only if:**
- Cold starts don't matter for your use case
- Cost savings aren't important
- You prefer more mature platform
- You don't want to manage another provider

**But consider:**
- You're paying 15% more for slower performance
- Users experience 2-4s delays on cold starts
- RunPod migration is low-risk and reversible

## Next Steps

### If Migrating to RunPod (Recommended)

1. Read `RUNPOD_QUICKSTART.md`
2. Run `./scripts/build-runpod-images.sh`
3. Deploy to RunPod (30 minutes)
4. Start 10% rollout
5. Monitor and scale to 100%

### If Keeping Modal

1. Document decision reasoning
2. Consider revisiting in 6 months
3. Monitor for Modal performance improvements
4. Track cost vs RunPod quarterly
