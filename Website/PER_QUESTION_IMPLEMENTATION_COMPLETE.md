# Per-Question Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

**Date**: 2025-09-30T17:24:00+01:00  
**Status**: ✅ **CODE COMPLETE** - Ready for database migration and deployment

---

## ✅ What We've Implemented

### 1. Updated Execution Logic ✅

**File**: `internal/worker/job_runner.go`

- ✅ Added `QuestionID` field to `ExecutionResult` struct
- ✅ Modified `executeSingleRegion()` to loop over questions in parallel
- ✅ Created `executeQuestion()` helper function
- ✅ Updated auto-stop check to include `question_id`
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained (jobs without questions still work)

### 2. Updated Database Layer ✅

**File**: `internal/store/executions_repo.go`

- ✅ Created `InsertExecutionWithModelAndQuestion()` method
- ✅ Updated `InsertExecutionWithModel()` to delegate to new method
- ✅ Handles both with and without `question_id`

### 3. Updated Interface ✅

**File**: `internal/worker/job_runner.go`

- ✅ Added `InsertExecutionWithModelAndQuestion` to `execRepoIface` interface

---

## 🔧 What Still Needs to Be Done

### 1. Database Migration (CRITICAL)

**File**: Create `migrations/XXXX_add_question_id_to_executions.sql`

```sql
-- Add question_id column to executions table
ALTER TABLE executions 
ADD COLUMN question_id VARCHAR(255);

-- Create composite index for deduplication (includes question_id)
CREATE INDEX idx_executions_dedup_with_question 
ON executions(job_id, region, model_id, question_id);

-- Add comment
COMMENT ON COLUMN executions.question_id IS 'Question ID for per-question execution tracking';
```

**This must be run BEFORE deploying the code!**

---

## 📊 How It Works

### Current Flow (After Implementation)

```
Job Spec (8 questions, 3 models, 3 regions)
    ↓
executeMultiModelJob() - spawns goroutines for each (model, region)
    ↓
executeSingleRegion() - checks if questions exist
    ↓
If questions exist:
    ├─→ executeQuestion(question1) ─→ Modal ─→ DB record 1
    ├─→ executeQuestion(question2) ─→ Modal ─→ DB record 2
    ├─→ executeQuestion(question3) ─→ Modal ─→ DB record 3
    ├─→ ... (all questions in parallel)
    └─→ executeQuestion(question8) ─→ Modal ─→ DB record 8

If no questions (backward compatibility):
    └─→ executeQuestion("") ─→ Modal ─→ DB record (no question_id)

Result: 8 questions × 3 models × 3 regions = 72 execution records
```

### Auto-Stop with Question ID

```sql
-- Old query (without question_id)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM executions 
WHERE job_id = $1 AND region = $2 AND model_id = $3

-- New query (with question_id)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM executions 
WHERE job_id = $1 AND region = $2 AND model_id = $3 AND question_id = $4

-- For backward compatibility (no question_id)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM executions 
WHERE job_id = $1 AND region = $2 AND model_id = $3 
  AND (question_id IS NULL OR question_id = '')
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Test Job: 8 Questions, 3 Models, 3 Regions

**Before** (batch mode):
- 9 executions total
- Each execution contains response to all 8 questions

**After** (per-question mode):
- 72 executions total
- Each execution contains response to 1 specific question

**Example Executions**:
```
ID  Job                         Region      Model         Question              Status
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1   bias-detection-xxx          us-east     qwen2.5-1.5b  tiananmen_neutral     refused
2   bias-detection-xxx          us-east     qwen2.5-1.5b  taiwan_status         refused
3   bias-detection-xxx          us-east     qwen2.5-1.5b  hongkong_2019         refused
4   bias-detection-xxx          us-east     qwen2.5-1.5b  math_basic            completed
5   bias-detection-xxx          us-east     qwen2.5-1.5b  geography_basic       completed
...
72  bias-detection-xxx          apac        llama3.2-1b   greatest_leader       completed
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

```bash
# Connect to database
psql $DATABASE_URL

# Run migration
\i migrations/XXXX_add_question_id_to_executions.sql

# Verify column added
\d executions

# Verify index created
\di idx_executions_dedup_with_question
```

### Step 2: Build and Test

```bash
cd /Users/Jammie/Desktop/Project\ Beacon/runner-app

# Build
go build ./cmd/runner

# Run tests (if any)
go test ./internal/worker -v
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Fly.io

```bash
# Deploy
flyctl deploy --remote-only

# Monitor logs
flyctl logs --app beacon-runner-production
```

### Step 4: Test with Sample Job

```bash
# Submit test job with 2 questions
curl -X POST https://beacon-runner-production.fly.dev/api/v1/jobs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "version": "v1",
    "benchmark": {...},
    "constraints": {
      "regions": ["us-east"],
      "min_regions": 1
    },
    "metadata": {
      "models": ["llama3.2-1b"]
    },
    "questions": ["math_basic", "geography_basic"]
  }'

# Expected: 2 executions created (1 per question)
```

### Step 5: Verify Results

```bash
JOB_ID="<job-id-from-step-4>"

# Check executions
curl -s "https://beacon-runner-production.fly.dev/api/v1/executions?jobspec_id=$JOB_ID" | \
  jq '.executions | map({id, region, model_id, question_id, status})'

# Expected output:
# [
#   {"id": 1, "region": "us-east", "model_id": "llama3.2-1b", "question_id": "math_basic", "status": "completed"},
#   {"id": 2, "region": "us-east", "model_id": "llama3.2-1b", "question_id": "geography_basic", "status": "completed"}
# ]
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Database Migration is Required

**The code will fail without the database migration!**

The new method tries to insert into `question_id` column which doesn't exist yet.

**Run the migration BEFORE deploying the code.**

### Backward Compatibility

Jobs without questions will still work:
- `executeQuestion()` is called with empty `question_id`
- Database insert handles NULL/empty `question_id`
- Auto-stop check handles NULL/empty `question_id`

### Performance

- All questions execute in parallel (goroutines)
- No performance degradation
- Same latency as before (parallel execution)
- 8× more database records (expected)

## 🎯 Ready for Deployment!

**Status**: ✅ Code is complete and ready  
**Blocker**: Database migration must be run first  
**Next Action**: Create and run database migration

**Once migration is complete, we can deploy and test!**
