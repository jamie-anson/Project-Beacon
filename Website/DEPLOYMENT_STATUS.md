## Database Migration Status

**Migration**: `0009_add_response_classification.up.sql`  
**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending verification

### Manual Migration (if needed):

**Option 1: Railway CLI**
```bash
railway connect
psql $DATABASE_URL -f /Users/Jammie/Desktop/Project\ Beacon/runner-app/migrations/0009_add_response_classification.up.sql
```

**Option 2: Railway Dashboard**
1. Go to Railway database service
2. Click "Connect"
3. Open SQL console
4. Copy/paste migration SQL
5. Execute

### Verify Migration:
```sql
-- Check new columns exist
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'executions'
AND column_name IN (
    'is_substantive',
    'is_content_refusal',
    'is_technical_error',
    'response_classification',
    'response_length',
    'system_prompt'
);

-- Expected: 6 rows returned

-- Check indexes created
SELECT indexname, indexdef
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE tablename = 'executions'
AND indexname LIKE '%classification%';

-- Expected: 4 indexes
```

## Troubleshooting

### Railway Build Fails

**Check:**
- Build logs for Go compilation errors
- Dependency issues in go.mod
- Test failures (if tests run during build)

**Fix:**
```bash
# Revert if needed
cd /Users/Jammie/Desktop/Project\ Beacon/runner-app
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

### Netlify Build Fails

**Check:**
- Build logs for npm/React errors
- Missing dependencies
- TypeScript/ESLint errors

**Fix:**
```bash
# Revert if needed
cd /Users/Jammie/Desktop/Project\ Beacon/Website
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

### Migration Issues

**Check:**
- Database connection
- Migration syntax
- Existing column conflicts

**Fix:**
```bash
# Run down migration
psql $DATABASE_URL -f migrations/0009_add_response_classification.down.sql

# Fix issues, then re-run up migration
psql $DATABASE_URL -f migrations/0009_add_response_classification.up.sql
```
