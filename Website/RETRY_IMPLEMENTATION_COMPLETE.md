# ‚úÖ Retry Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented complete retry functionality for failed questions in Project Beacon, addressing cold start timeout issues.

---

## üéØ What Was Built

### Phase 1: Backend (‚úÖ COMPLETE)

#### 1. Database Migration
**File:** `/runner-app/migrations/0010_add_retry_tracking.up.sql`
- Added retry tracking columns to `executions` table
- `retry_count`, `max_retries`, `last_retry_at`, `retry_history`, `original_error`
- Indexes for efficient retry queries

#### 2. RetryService
**File:** `/runner-app/internal/service/retry_service.go`
- Fetches original job spec from database
- Extracts specific question by index
- Converts question ID to actual prompt text
- Calls hybrid router for inference
- Updates execution with success/failure
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

#### 3. API Endpoint
**File:** `/runner-app/internal/api/executions_handler.go`
- `POST /api/v1/executions/:id/retry-question`
- Validates retry eligibility (failed/timeout/error status)
- Enforces max 3 retry attempts
- Updates retry count and history atomically
- Async execution via goroutine (non-blocking)

#### 4. Route Configuration
**File:** `/runner-app/internal/api/routes.go`
- Wires up RetryService with hybrid client
- Reads `HYBRID_ROUTER_URL` from environment
- Integrates with ExecutionsHandler

#### 5. Backend Proxy (Python)
**File:** `/backend/app/api/v1/routes/executions.py`
- Proxies retry requests to runner app
- Comprehensive error handling (404, 400, 429, 503, 504)
- 60s timeout for retry operations

#### 6. Frontend API Client
**File:** `/portal/src/lib/api/runner/executions.js`
- `retryQuestion(executionId, region, questionIndex)`
- `retryAllFailed(executionId)` for future batch operations
- Integrated with existing `runnerFetch` HTTP client

---

### Phase 2: Frontend UI (‚úÖ COMPLETE)

#### LiveProgressTable Component
**File:** `/portal/src/components/bias-detection/LiveProgressTable.jsx`

**Added Features:**
1. **`isQuestionFailed()` helper** - Detects failed/timeout/error executions
2. **Retry button** - Replaces "Answer" link for failed questions
3. **`handleRetryQuestion()` handler** - Async retry with loading states
4. **Loading states** - Shows "Retrying..." during retry operation
5. **Toast notifications** - Success/error feedback
6. **Auto-refetch** - Updates UI 2 seconds after retry
7. **Duplicate prevention** - Prevents concurrent retries for same question

**Visual Changes:**
- Failed questions: Yellow "Retry" button (instead of greyed "Answer")
- During retry: "Retrying..." text with disabled state
- Success: Toast notification + auto-refresh
- Error: Toast notification with error message

---

## üîÑ How It Works

### User Flow:
1. User sees failed question with "Retry" button
2. Clicks "Retry"
3. Frontend calls `POST /api/v1/executions/{id}/retry-question`
4. Backend validates and increments retry count
5. Async goroutine re-runs inference via hybrid router
6. Database updated with new results
7. UI auto-refreshes after 2 seconds
8. User sees updated status

### Technical Flow:
```
Portal (LiveProgressTable)
  ‚Üì retryQuestion(executionId, region, questionIndex)
Frontend API Client
  ‚Üì POST /api/v1/executions/:id/retry-question
Runner App (ExecutionsHandler)
  ‚Üì Validate & Update DB
  ‚Üì Spawn goroutine
RetryService
  ‚Üì Fetch job spec
  ‚Üì Extract question
  ‚Üì Call hybrid router
  ‚Üì Update execution
Database (executions table)
```

## üìã Implementation Checklist

### Backend ‚úÖ
- [x] Database migration for retry tracking
- [x] RetryService implementation
- [x] API endpoint with validation
- [x] Route configuration
- [x] Backend proxy (Python)
- [x] Frontend API client

### Frontend ‚úÖ
- [x] Failed question detection
- [x] Retry button UI
- [x] Retry handler with loading states
- [x] Toast notifications
- [x] Auto-refetch after retry
- [x] Duplicate retry prevention

### Future Enhancements üîÆ

---

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing Steps:

1. **Create a job that will timeout:**
   ```bash
   # Submit job via portal
   # Wait for execution to fail/timeout
   ```

2. **Verify retry button appears:**
   - Expand region in Live Progress Table
   - Failed questions should show yellow "Retry" button

3. **Test retry:**
   - Click "Retry" button
   - Verify "Retrying..." state
   - Wait for toast notification
   - Verify execution updates to "completed"

4. **Test max retries:**
   - Retry same question 3 times
   - 4th attempt should return 429 error

### API Testing:
```bash
# Get failed execution ID
curl http://localhost:8090/api/v1/jobs/{job_id}/executions/all

# Retry question
curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/api/v1/executions/{execution_id}/retry-question \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"region": "us-east", "question_index": 0}'

# Check updated status
curl http://localhost:8090/api/v1/executions/{execution_id}/details
```

## üöÄ Deployment

### Prerequisites:
1. Run database migration:
   ```bash
   # Migration will be applied automatically on startup
   # Or manually: psql -f migrations/0010_add_retry_tracking.up.sql
   ```

2. Set environment variable:
   ```bash
   export HYBRID_ROUTER_URL="https://project-beacon-production.up.railway.app"
   ```

### Deploy Steps:
1. Deploy runner app with new code
2. Deploy backend proxy (Python)
3. Deploy portal with updated LiveProgressTable
4. Verify retry endpoint is accessible
5. Test with failed execution

---

## üìä Success Metrics

- [x] Failed questions show "Retry" button
- [x] Retry re-runs inference for specific question
- [x] Max 3 retry attempts enforced
- [x] Toast notifications on success/failure
- [x] UI shows loading state during retry
- [x] Progress updates after retry completes

---

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **No retry attempt counter in UI** - Future enhancement
2. **No batch retry** - Future enhancement
3. **Async execution** - No real-time progress during retry (uses polling)
4. **Question ID mapping** - Hardcoded in RetryService (should use database)
